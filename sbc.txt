LENORE:  So you don't need to go . borrow equipment from anybody, 
to -- 
 to do the feet? 
 [Do the hooves]? 
LYNNE: [(H)=] <YWN Well, 
we're gonna have to find somewhere, 
to get, 
(Hx)  something (Hx) YWN>. 
DORIS:  So, 
[~Mae-] -- 
LYNNE: [I'm gonna] (Hx) -- 
DORIS: [2~Mae ~Lynne XX2] 
LYNNE: [2(H) We're not2] gonna do the feet today, 
I'm gonna wait till like, 
early in the morning=, 
 to do those, 
cause y- -- 
I mean you get s=o ti=red. 
(H)  n- you just, 
 it takes % -- 
well, 
it takes me longer than most people, 
cause you know, 
I'm not as stro=ng and, 
(H)  and I'm not as good, 
as like somebody that would do it  all the ti=me. 
 You know. 
 I mean, 
 (H) % <X Oh X> -- 
I mean I trim horses=, 
and stuff like that, 
but I mean, 
I'm not like, 
(H)  <@ I'm no=t uh= @>, 
@ 
(H) I don't know how to say it. 
But you know, 
they do it for a living. 
you know, 
 most people that you would get to trim your horse do it  all the ti=me. 
 (H)= and I'm not (Hx)  that good or, 
 [and I'm not] very strong. 
LENORE: [Did they train you-] -- 
LYNNE: [2yeah2]. 
LENORE: [2Did2] they train you that -- 
X[3X3]* 
LYNNE: [3yeah3]. 
 yeah. 
LENORE:  [So you have your] own equipment, 
LYNNE: [(H)] 
LENORE: but, 
LYNNE:  (TSK) (H) No. 
I don't have my own equipment at all. 
 Da=d, 
 you know, 
has done some of it. 
That's another thing too, 
is I kinda had a b=- general idea=, 
 (H).. of kinda how to do it, 
just watching hi=m. 
or= -- 
and watching, 
 (H) people come to our place, 
and doing it and stuff you know. 
(H)=  and, 
 (TSK) . I don't know. 
then%, 
 down there=, 
um=, 
it's mandatory=. 
you have to % -- 
to graduate, 
you know, 
or well, 
to get the degree, 
you know, 
(H)  you have to take this class. 
(H) And you can only take- -- 
if you want to, 
you can only take it for eight weeks. 
(H)= And, 
 if you wanna go on in it, 
you n- -- 
then, 
you can go on. 
you know. 
 And I decided to go ahead and go on in it. 
 And the first part of it, 
 is like, 
(H) well we have lecture, 
 then we have la=b. 
(H)  And like, 
the first part of it, 
 we just go into the classroo=m, 
and he like, 
(H)=  In the beginning of the year there was a lot of classroom work. 
 I mean, 
 it- -- 
that's just kinda= how it happens, 
you know, 
because he kinda has to tell you, 
(H)=  they go over=, 
 the who=le, 
 the who=le part  of the horse. 
 I mean, 
(H)  all the skeleton= .. part of it you know=, 
and- -- 
and they go through  %every kinda ligament. 
and I mean, 
there's, 
 (H) millions of ligaments, 
and millions of  tendons, 
you know, 
well not millions, 
but, 
 I mean, 
LENORE: yeah, 
[I bet]. 
LYNNE: [(H) and <X then X>], 
so we had to know these tendons, 
and ligaments, 
(H) and then, 
all the bones, 
 and, 
 you know, 
all the way up- from the shou=lder down, 
and then from the hip down. 
 You know, 
all the way down to the hoof, 
(H) and then, 
% the bo=ne in the hoof, 
and, 
(H)=  then all the .. wall, 
and, 
% you know, 
of the hoof, 
and, 
what everything was called there, 
and then, 
(H) he went over on how= to trim it, 
and where you- -- 
th- there's a white line, 
that you go by, 
and a horse  has this little white line, 
(H) and you clean it out with the -- 
 (TSK) with the hoof knife? 
you know? 
(H) and then there- -- 
% and then you can see this little white line? 
(H) and that's kinda where you go by, 
to -- 
<SM %  you know, 
the horse kinda helps you out, 
because it, 
 has that .. little white line right the[re. 
LENORE: [mhm]. 
LYNNE: and that]'s where you kinda SM> -- 
(H) kinda need a little guide, 
of where you trim. 
 (TSK) (H) And, 
 I= am still scared to do it. 
because, 
%_you know, 
 I mean, 
<HI you can make HI> a horse go lame, 
(H) By doing [it-]. 
LENORE: [really]. 
LYNNE: Well you can trim em too short. 
 % (H) And make em, 
you know, 
and they're just  a little bit, 
for f- -- 
the first couple of days, 
you know, 
I mean they're just  sore. 
(H) That's not bad, 
but sometimes you can get it really bad. 
You can really make a horse really bad. 
(H)= And they m- -- 
you know then=, 
% they have to, 
like, 
 (H) keep em (Hx), 
 away from anything, 
you know, 
get em really in the so=ft ground, 
and, 
 no= .. hard pebbles, 
or hard  clods of dirt or anything? 
(H)= So %, 
 (%Hx) (TSK) (H) I don't know. 
I'm=  a little scared .. about doing it yet. 
you know, 
I get em really long. 
I mean they're still long. 
 When I get done with them, 
(H) <SM A lo=t of times, 
like I'll get done, 
and I'll think I'm done, 
and I'll look at- -- 
look down at the horse's hoof SM>, 
 and it's still, 
 it's too= .. long. 
 (H)= And then like, 
 I would never, 
 ever, 
 ever, 
trust myself, 
 to shoe a horse. 
 See we did that too. 
we did -- 
(H)= We= did a lot of stuff. 
we did a lot of stuff with the -- 
like we had the, 
um, 
 (TSK) the bur=ners? 
you know, 
and you'd put the -- 
(H) you'd have -- 
you started out with the straight  iron? 
 you know? 
(H) and you'd stick it into the, 
 into the, 
 (H) you know like, 
<SM actual bla=cksmithing. 
 (H) And you'd put it into the ho=t SM> .. coa=ls, 
you know? 
(H) And then, 
we'd % -- 
%i- %i- straight bar, 
and we'd make it a- -- 
a horseshoe out of it, 
you know=? 
 (H) But, 
% -- 
these shoes we never did put on a horse. 
(H)  We just [put] the shoes that were already made, 
LENORE: [(THROAT)] 
[2(THROAT)2] 
LYNNE: [2on2] a horse. 
(H)  And that's as far as we got. 
I mean, 
if you would really get into it, 
(H) Well as a matter of fact, 
(H) this is really funny. 
You know, 
there isn't  really .. any girl farriers .. around anywhere. 
They're [really] -- 
LENORE: [farrier]? 
LYNNE: (H)  th- Yeah. 
farrier is what they're called. 
 (H) And the m- % -- 
 the reason they were showing us this at college, 
was just, 
 to get us, 
(H) to know if our= trimmer=, 
and shoer were_s  doing it right, 
and- -- 
(H) plus the knowledge of knowing the bones and ligaments. 
which we=, 
 we had it in another class too. 
we -- 
(H) that was kind of a double thing that, 
% we had in- -- 
 in another class, 
so it was kinda review for us. 
(H) well it was a review for some people, 
depend on what time of the year you took it. 
You know. 
(H) if it was a review or not. 
(H) But, 
 (TSK) anyway, 
um, 
 <PAR<P what was I gonna say. 
 I forgot what I was think- -- 
LENORE: You sai[d you never] made the horseshoes, 
LYNNE: [gonna say] P>PAR>. 
LENORE: but, 
LYNNE:  (H) Well, 
%  %w- u=m, 
%= when we put em on a horse's hoof, 
all we do, 
(H) they're already made. 
 they're round. 
 we pick out a size. 
 you know we'd, 
like look at the horse's hoof, 
and say, 
okay, 
(H) this is a double-aught. 
this is an aught. 
 (H) this is, 
you know. 
 what s- -- 
what size. 
 and double-aught and aught, 
% are the  ones that are most popular. 
(H)=  % For=, 
 (TSK) you know, 
the light horse. 
You know, 
I mean, 
you get into the big horses, 
the -- 
like the Clydesdales, 
Shires, 
that's a d- -- 
a whole different thing. 
(H) Or ponies, 
that's a whole different thing. 
(H) But we're talking just the regular, 
 light horses you know. 
(H)  A=nd, 
aught and aught -- 
<X %uh X> %augh=t, 
and double-aught, 
are the two sizes. 
 (H) Well anyway, 
you go get your -- 
 Okay, 
this is after you trimmed em. 
 (H) And you go get your shoe, 
 It's already made. 
It's already round. 
You pick out your size. 
(H)=  %_You go look, 
and every horse's hoof is shaped different. 
It doesn't matter. 
every horse is gonna have  a little .. different shape. 
(H)  And so [what you have] to [2do=2], 
LENORE: [So every] -- 
[2every2] uh=, 
horseshoe is made -- 
custom-made for the horse then? 
LYNNE: (H) No no. 
 (H) No. 
What -- 
What we do, 
then that's  that's where the ferrier comes in. 
 (H) Every shoe, 
is like, 
 you get- order, 
you know, 
I would like a b- case of double-aught shoes=. 
You'd get- -- 
 (H) The ferrier gets em. 
 You know, 
that's the way it goes, 
(H)  And then=, 
 (TSK) %_Our job, 
is to shape the shoe, 
 to the horse's foot. 
 (H) And that, 
it d- it sounds easy, 
 but it's really hard to do. 
 I mean, 
(H) some of em you have to, 
% you know, 
like say, 
okay, 
say your shoe's % like thi=s? 
 (H) and your horse's foot is just really wide or something=? 
 (H) Well then you have to put it on the anvil, 
and get the shoe stretched out, 
(H) well then once you stretch the shoe out, 
 well then, 
(H) the two corners. 
they go out, 
too. 
 you know, 
okay your shoe's like this? 
(H) You stretch this out, 
well then it's gonna make these go way out, 
too, 
and they get like this? 
LENORE: [Right]. 
LYNNE: [(H)] then you have to round these back, 
 you know? 
 (H) It's just, 
 % %it s- it sounds easy, 
but it's really hard to do, 
and then, 
(H) I would never do it, 
cause I'd never trust myself to do it. 
(H) I mean we ha=d to [do it], 
LENORE: [(THROAT)] 
LYNNE: but, 
it's just that people would volunteer their horses to the college, 
because, 
(H)=  it costs like thirty bucks to get your horse shod. 
 I mean, 
that's just how much it costs. 
Could you imagine all those horses out there, 
if we had em all shod? 
that's -- 
LENORE: [How many have you got]. 
LYNNE: [(H) thirty] bucks, 
for twenty horses- -- 
LENORE: twen[ty]. 
LYNNE: [twen]ty-eight horses, 
you know=? 
(H) I mean, 
 Jesus, 
that would be a th-  nine hundred dollars, 
<<SNAP +just SNAP>> like tha=t. 
 <SM I mean, 
could you imagine SM> ? 
(H) So, 
 w- you know, 
 like, 
a lot of people, 
 that have a lot of horses and stuff, 
 and that they're riding a lot, 
they'll just, 
(H)  let the college kids do em. 
 For em you know. 
(H) They're taking the risk, 
 of having their horse  get lame, 
but, 
(H)  It really never happens, 
cause we have our s- instructor right there, 
telling us, 
this is what you do. 
(H) And it's not like, 
 there's a person that's just gung ho, 
and goes and just, 
(H)= trims their feet, 
and puts the shoe on, 
you know=, 
you d- you d- you ca=n't do that. 
And so we have our instructor right there, 
and we asked a million questions, 
 all the time I mean, 
(H) he e- -- 
he just runs around. 
everywhere. 
 you know. 
 (SWALLOW) so it's % -- 
 (H) .. But uh, 
 <P<PAR What was I gonna say PAR>P>. 
 (TSK) % Oh, 
and it's really tiring though. 
 (H) And it % -- 
you know like, 
 you get so- -- 
I='ve  only done like, 
(H)  well (Hx), 
 at the% end of the year, 
now see, 
I took the second half of the course. 
 (H) And, 
%  right now, 
I've probably, 
 only shod about, 
 five horses. 
 (H) Trimmed a lot of em. 
(H) And you know what we start out with? 
[This is the] grossest of everything. 
LENORE: [<X What X>]. 
LYNNE: (H) We start out, 
(H)  with, 
 dead horse hooves. 
 (H)= I mean, 
% % you know, 
<X the% X> the canneries, 
you know and stuff you know=? 
 The people that -- 
(H)=  that -- 
 kill the horses for meat and stuff? 
 You know they have all these le=gs and stuff? 
(H)= And -- 
 I don't know, 
everybody [%=] -- 
LENORE: [I thought] they used the (THROAT) the horsehooves in  for gelatin, 
That's not so? 
LYNNE:  (H) <HI You know, 
I think they do HI>, 
I think a lot of times, 
but, 
 then they, 
 they probably use em for everything- -- 
I don't know what all they use em for. 
(H) But anyway, 
we=  (TSK) get .. these horse hooves, 
from this one cannery, 
 (H) they -- 
they have to go, 
 a long ways to go get em, 
like back East somewhere, 
to get these  horse hooves. 
(H) For the college. 
(H) They go back %  East, 
and they get em. 
and they freeze em you know? 
 (H) So we have this frozen horse hoof, 
that we have to start out on, 
cause you don't want to  cripple up a .. (H) really good horse, 
and like, 
my first hoof, 
(H)  that horse would have been, 
 lame, 
@ @ <@ like cra=zy. 
@ @ (H) But @>, 
(H) it was just, 
and, 
oh, 
God, 
it's so= gross, 
because, 
(H)  sometimes if you get one that's been thawed out a little bit, 
 they start really stinking and stuff? 
Oh, 
it's the grossest thing. 
Oh, 
it's just so icky. 
(H) <HI I mean, 
you have this HI> (H)  piece of @horse @@@@ -- 
<@<HI I mean this leg that's @> HI>, 
oh, 
it's just gross. 
(H) And like in some of em? 
 (TSK) blood will spurt out, 
you know, 
and I mean, 
oh. 
(H) It's @nothing @ -- 
<@SM (H) it's the grossest thing SM@>. 
(H) And that's why -- 
 that's probably why they have to make that class mandatory, 
because at the beginning of the year, 
it's just the% -- 
it's the pits. 
(H) But once you get into it, 
it's the funnest thing and=, 
you know, 
it's really interesting, 
to do stuff like tha=t. 
(H)  But, 
 I would have never got into that class, 
if -- 
 (H) there's no way, 
if I didn't have to have it, 
there's no way. 
I mean, 
(H)  I heard everybody saying um- -- 
you know, 
like the people that took the class before, 
(H) talking about, 
 <VOX Oh, 
you have to do this, 
you have to do that, 
there's dead horse hooves, 
you know you gotta, 
(H) and they stink VOX>, 
and all this other stuff, 
and I was just going, 
<Q oh my G=o=d, 
I'm never -- 
I= don't want to take that class. 
so maybe I'll wait till next year Q>, 
and then I thought, 
no, 
I'll get it out of the way now. 
(H)= And then once I got into it, 
geez, 
I wanna take the second half of it, 
it was just really interesting to me, 
you know? 
(H)  But, 
(Hx)  (TSK) at first it was kind of a bummer. 
 But, 
(H) I'm glad I took it. 
 Really glad. 
 (TSK) It pays off. 
Especially, 
%_you know, 
(H)  twelve bucks, 
for a trim. 
 I mean that's twelve bucks, 
every time I can go out, 
and trim my own horse's hooves. 
LENORE: [Right]. 
LYNNE: [(H)=] You know, 
and I wouldn't trust myself to do it, 
 with, 
 a horse that I was really using a lot, 
or anything, 
but the ones that are standing around, 
(H)  that's still twelve dollars, 
you know, 
I mean whether the horse being used a lot or not, 
that's twelve bucks. 
and, 
(H)=  shoot, 
I can do those, 
you know? 
 But, 
I always have, 
anybody -- 
(H) I always have somebody that really knows what they're doing, 
for the horses that I'm really really using. 
 (TSK) (H) But anyway, 
(TSK)  I wanna wait until the morning. 
 to do that. 
 because, 
(H)= It's just, 
 too hot in the afternoon, 
to try to sit out there. 
(H) I mean you can get, 
 just, 
 exhausted. 
(H) Anyway, 
I was gonna tell you about that %- -- 
 the girl, 
you know, 
there isn't mary-  very many, 
 ferrier girl=s you know? 
And her heart, 
LYNNE: That do this? 
(H) This summer I met one. 
(H) !Jorgensen's, 
they have  one  shoer, 
that comes to their house, 
all the time, 
they've had him for years and years and years. 
(H) And I guess like in Minnesota it's real we=t, 
 and stuff you know? 
So like, 
 they really have to watch their shoes, 
for not coming off, 
because the hoof wall, 
is so much softer. 
(H) It's like, 
when you're down there, 
your hands are softer and everything you know, 
and they're not  as dry= or anything? 
(H) When you get back here, 
we have dry hooves. 
we have to watch out for like uh, 
(H)  like the hooves being too= dry. 
we have to put ointment on em and stuff. 
(H) The- -- 
Back there they're too we=t. 
(H) Not this time of the year, 
because, 
 you know, 
they've had a dry year, 
but, 
(H)= usually they're too wet, 
and that- -- 
 that shoe can just pull righ=t o=ff=, 
because it's just, 
(H)  the hoof wall is so soft. 
LENORE:  [Yeah]. 
LYNNE: [It seems] weird, 
that that's [2like2] that, 
LENORE: [2X2] 
LYNNE: (H) you know, 
and I nei- -- 
I never knew that, 
until I took this class, 
either. 
 I didn't realize that in- -- 
(H) you know, 
if you think about it, 
yeah, 
if it rains a lot, 
the horse is always we=t? 
And it's always moist, 
and it's always on something moi=st? 
LENORE: [Yeah]. 
LYNNE: [(TSK) (H)] Sure it's gonna be softer. 
(H) But I never even thought about that until I took this class. 
So it's -- 
you know that's  kinda stuff too that you think about. 
(H) But anyway, 
 (TSK) they always have this one horseshoer, 
and, 
(H) this girl's been  in this f=errier, 
 uh, 
she's going to an actual  ferrier college. 
(H) They have a lo=t of those around. 
 a lo=t. 
(H) And she's going to one of em, 
and she's been going for, 
 like nine months. 
 to this one, 
and she's still got [a lot more=], 
DORIS: [<X Where is the, 
uh= X>], 
LYNNE: (H) left to go. 
 What? 
DORIS: Where [is the XX]. 
LYNNE: [Oh. 
Right] here. 
DORIS:  Guess I'll put it o=n, 
it's not on, 
[XX]. 
LYNNE: [(TSK)] But %anyway=, 
She ha=s, 
 um, 
 (H) she -- 
he's like taking her as a- -- 
 % you know=, 
hel=ping her ou=t, 
and stuff, 
you know, 
for the summer, 
she's been working with him all summer? 
 (H) And, 
 @it's really different, 
to see a girl doing it. 
you know. 
you just % don't see that. 
>ENV: ((AIR_CONDITIONER_FAN_BEGINS)) 
LYNNE:  at all. 
 ever. 
(H) !Jorgensen's have a=  g=irl- -- 
 or a g- -- 
 you know a guy, 
they've had a guy= being a horseshoer for, 
a long time you know? 
(H) And they, 
are um, 
 (TSK) (H) there's this girl, 
that's working with him, 
for the summer? 
DORIS: Unhunh. 
LYNNE: And she's gonna be a ferrier. 
DORIS:  Yeah. 
LYNNE:  I couldn't believe it. 
<HI And she's just little HI>. 
 She's a tiny girl, 
but, 
boy I tell you, 
she's got ar=ms the size of -- 
 (H) they're hu=ge. 
but she must only -- 
 <HI What is m- . blowing out of there HI>. 
DORIS: Well, 
that's what happens with that air conditioner. 
it's just -- 
 it gets dust accumulated in it, 
see it's all over the TV=. 
LYNNE:  It was just o=n last night, 
how does it get du=st [in it already]. 
DORIS: [We=ll, 
I] -- 
It  ~Mae ~Lynne, 
 for one thing the .. filters are dirty because it .. it so -- 
 been so dry. 
 And the -- 
 it all comes acrost, 
 the road. 
 you know? 
 and, 
 and then it builds up real bad with, 
 (H) (COUGH) deposits, 
out of the water. 
LYNNE: Oh=. 
DORIS: [In other words] I  should be .. change filters. 
LYNNE: [Ugh=]. 
 Go=d. 
DORIS:  I know. 
 It won't last long. 
 But, 
 it sure does make a mess in the house. 
LYNNE: Yeah=. 
it [makes a mess]. 
DORIS: [<X I need X> new] filters. 
XX 
LYNNE:  Anyway, 
this girl must only weigh like, 
a hundred and ten pou=nds. 
(H)  I mean, 
she's just a little shit. 
and she's out there, 
and she's got hu=ge arms. 
I mean she's in shape like you can't believe. 
(H)  She's @out there just, 
(H)  working away. 
 And, 
those guys are so u=sed to it, 
that they do it all day long. 
you know. 
LENORE: M[hm], 
LYNNE: [And] that doesn't bother em a bit, 
to just go out there and, 
 trim and trim and trim. 
(H)  And shoe, 
and everything, 
but, 
 for me= (Hx), 
 that's something I'm not used to. 
and boy I tell you. 
(H) you just -- 
sweat just ro=lls off of you@. 
@I@ just, 
(H) <HI it's HI> tiring. 
 The very -- 
%  at the very beginning=, 
. when we first started doing it, 
we only did like one hoof? 
(H) Then we moved up to two=, 
 Then we moved up to a full horse, 
you know? 
(H)= And, 
 We were just slowly got in shape. 
doing that. 
you know? 
 (H) But now if I went to do that? 
Ho=ly smokes. 
 I'd never be able to @handle it. 
LENORE: (TSK) Why=. 
LYNNE:  It's just -- 
it's a -- 
it's har=d wor=k. 
 It is really hard work. 
(H)  You're bent o=ver=, 
and it's % -- 
 you know, 
it takes <% like %> -- 
 I don't know why you sweat so bad doing it either, 
but you jus=t, 
oh, 
it's just, 
(H)  it's just har=d hard work. 
It's- -- 
(H) it doesn't seem like it would be, 
but, 
 (SWALLOW) it is. 
It's really takes a lot of muscles to do it too. 
I mean a lo=t. 
(H) Those -- 
 It's hard. 
LENORE: <X You don't X> get kicked a lot? 
LYNNE:  (TSK) I've never been kicked, 
ever. 
 (H) But like, 
it- those college h- is course, 
you know, 
like I was talking, 
our horses are a little better than, 
(H) most people's horse, 
cause they've been arou=nd people a lo=t? 
(H) And they%, 
 they don't get by with stuff. 
I mean, 
we do get mad at our horses for, 
 @ (H) you know, 
whatever they do wrong, 
we do get mad at em, 
(TSK) like I noticed, 
(H) horses at college, 
they just haven't been disciplined enough. 
and they're just, 
 (H) it's like a kid, 
they're just, 
 are ornery, 
you know? 
(H) And like, 
they'll move arou=nd, 
and, 
%  kinda be ornery about half way, 
but not  not too bad. 
 I've never been  kicked doing it at all. 
(H) And that's another thing we had to learn in the class you know, 
just had to learn  our safety of, 
(H) where to stand, 
and how to stand, 
 (H) You have to stand like these certain ways, 
and, 
 oh and it's a killer on your back, 
cause you're standing like this. 
Oh I'm sorry !Berry. 
(H) You're [standing] -- 
>ENV: [((MICROPHONE))]= 
LYNNE: Whoops. 
@ (H) 
 You're standing like thi=s you know? 
(H) And like, 
%when you're in the back, 
the horse's hoof  %_lays like this right over you? 
and you're, 
 like this working? 
you know? 
(H) This is like a hoof knife, 
then a -- 
@you [@know]. 
LENORE: [So you're always bent over]. 
LYNNE: You're always bent over. 
 And like in the front? 
(H) You stick the horse's hoof  between your leg, 
you know? 
 (TSK) (H) Kinda like that, 
and you kinda, 
you go like this, 
you kinda bend down like this, 
and you have the horse's hoof [right here]? 
LENORE: [It's hard on your back]. 
LYNNE: (H)= It's really hard on your back. 
 Like, 
 I noticed that girl's back muscles were just tremendous. 
too you know. 
 Couldn't believe it. 
 She had like on this  really .. p- kinda short shirt, 
you know? 
(H) 
<X There's this X> -- 
 (H) I think that's cold. 
LENORE:  Just don't -- 
 it's -- 
if you rub something against it, 
it's just -- 
LYNNE:  Makes a sound? 
 (H) Nka=y. 
LENORE:  So what -- 
 what were you gonna do out there today. 
What other -- 
 what other things <X were you X> gonna -- 
LYNNE:  (H) Just go out and um, 
LENORE:  (TSK) Look at the filly? 
LYNNE:  (H) Yeah=. 
 (H) .. I think more or less (Hx), 
it's getting about, 
 so late now. 
 Pretty much all we're gonna do is go out, 
 I don't know what her plans really are. 
 But I think pretty much just go out and take care of em and then, 
(H) maybe go to that  seasonal dance, 
or whatever it is. 
 Is that what it's called? 
LENORE:  I don't know. 
LYNNE:  I don't know what it's called either. 
 (H) You know, 
he said there was four guy=s doing that? 
LENORE:  Doing what. 
LYNNE:  % The dance, 
you know? 
 How he said there's four guys, 
I wonder if that means like, 
 (H) Since there's four seasons, 
you know? 
I wonder if [that has] something to do with it, 
LENORE: [Unhunh]. 
LYNNE: since he called it a seasonal [2dance2]. 
LENORE: [2XX2] 
LYNNE: (H)=  He's a pretty neat guy. 
 I thought. 
LENORE:  <@ Yeah, 
he spoke Crow okay @>. 
(H) 
LYNNE:  @ (H) 
 I got a kick out of him when he kept saying it-, 
(H) <@ See this little cat @>. 
 (Hx) (H)  [Little cat-] -- 
LENORE: [I don't wanna] see the little cat. 
 [2I know, 
LYNNE: [2I know,

Well,

LYNNE:  <@ Oh did they @>? 
 Hunh. 
 That's funny. 
 (H) . Look at how much that air conditioner blew on that blue bag right there. 
LENORE:  Yeah, 
I noticed on the -- 
 on the case for the tape recorder too, 
<X that it's all X> -- 
that it's all covered today. 
 [Look right here]. 
LYNNE: [Look at your cig]arettes even.

 On the way into r- --

 yesterday morning, 
the radio was on? 
 And they were, 
 talking about the weather and they said, 
 (H) how we-, 
everybody woke up with ash all over their car today, 
and, 
LYNNE:  In Roundup? 
LENORE:  On the way from Roundup. 
 I was listening to the radio. 
 Yesterday morning. 
 [And they were talking] -- 
LYNNE: [And so this was] probably like a Billings radio station, 
or [2something like that? 
LENORE: [2Yeah, 
 Unhunh2]. 
LYNNE: (H)2]  Is that ri=ght. 
LENORE: And they said well everybody woke up with ashes on their car today. 
 And I guess just from the fires. 
DORIS: Yeah, 
it is. 
LYNNE: (H) 
DORIS: I was telling [~Mae ~Lynne], 
LYNNE: [Hunh]. 
DORIS:  Uh, 
 day before yesterday, 
it was the most weird day I've ever seen in my entire adult l=ife. 
 It was um, 
 the wind was blowing real hot when I first got up. 
 And it was early. 
 Real early, 
like seven o'clock in the morning, 
that -- 
 that wind was just hot. 
(H)= And, 
n=ext thing you knew, 
it was just overcast, 
 well the smoke all blew in. 
Just like there was a fire. 
right around close. 
(H) And it was just  dense. 
You couldn't even hardly see, 
very far away. 
(H) Okay then, 
 it -- 
 that-- 
 s- - -- 
 it just kinda blew the smoke in, 
and then blew it out, 
but, 
(H) then it was real hazy, 
and there was just dust particles, 
all over. 
and it was, 
(H) you'd look at the sun, 
and it would just look red. 
I mean you couldn't see= the sun. 
 It was just -- 
LYNNE:  She said people were driving around with their lights on. 
DORIS: Yeah. 
And the lights were -- 
 they didn't look like they were -- 
 it's just from the drought and the dust, 
 you know, 
 and the smoke in the air. 
 I've never seen anything like it. 
LYNNE:  And she said like, 
 the lights looked= .. a greenish color. 
DORIS: Yeah. 
[They look a green XXXX]. 
LYNNE: [You know how they look yellow at night, 
you know]? 
DORIS:  Yeah. 
they just looked green. 
 It was a wei=rd. 
 ugly. 
 ugly day. 
 !Rana !Lee's gonna have a baby by the way.

LYNNE:  [!Brian's ] wife?

did mom tell you, 
 about !Deb at all? 
 She probably really couldn't, 
since !Genetta was there. 
(H) You know, 
she was- -- 
like she was in the hospital, 
in and out of the hospital all the time and stuff, 
ever since she was little, 
 (H) she was in and out of the hospital, 
DORIS:  Who was that. 
!Debby?

LYNNE: [You know], 
stuff like that, 
but she wouldn't quit riding em. 
so, 
DORIS:  [Well XX], 
LYNNE: [she's allergic to] everything, 
[2it doesn't matter2]. 
DORIS: [2XXX was saying2],

she never did take shots. 
[Did she].

They should've, 
 they should have gotten her -- 
LYNNE:  I don't know why they didn't [either]. 
DORIS: [I -- 
% I] w- always wondered about that, 
and she was s- -- 
 she had such severe asthma, 
that, 
(H) I would have done a [little bit more for her I think]. 
LYNNE: [(H) If you wanna talk about somebody] tired, 
that girl, 
 that girl couldn't . walk down to the street and back, 
without taking a nap. 
 And me and mom always accused her of being lazy. 
 You know, 
because she was just, 
 <HI all she did was sleep HI>. 
LENORE:  She sounded like she had [more problems than] -- 
LYNNE: [and now that when] we think about it, 
 she probably wasn't really . lazy, 
she's probably just exhausted, 
I mean, 
(H) you know, 
if you think about it, 
we like take  everything for granted. 
We take our air for granted. 
You know? 
 Then somebody like that, 
 every little breath is like  and effort to em, 
d- -- 
and you know, 
and if I had to go through an effort, 
just in breathing, 
all the time, 
(H) 
DORIS:  Well !Deb[by got-] -- 
LYNNE: [I would be] tired too. 
DORIS:  !Debby got to the point, 
where all she would do is, 
when she did, 
 you know every- -- 
 just, 
 really often she would go (H)=, 
to try to get enough air in, 
 and her, 
they had an autopsy done on her. 
And her heart, 
 was just hard, 
on one side, 
from, 
(H) labored breathing all of her life. 
It had just labored her heart so bad. 
(H) She actually died of a heart attack. 
LYNNE: She did. 
DORIS: Yeah. 
LYNNE:  They did have an autopsy done on [her]. 
DORIS: [Yes]. 
 It surprised me. 
 But they -- 
they did. 
 And it was actually a -- 
LYNNE: And her heart was [ha=rd]? 
DORIS: [cardiac arrest]. 
 Mhm. 
(H) One side of her heart was just hard. 
from, 
 the muscle -- 
the muscle was just hard, 
from just  [labored breathing, 
LYNNE: [Gee=z]. 
DORIS: <X trying] to breathe all the time X>. 
LYNNE:  That's just sick. 
Doris:  Yeah, 
we thought she was just lazy, 
and kind of worthless, 
but, 
 we didn't realize what she was going through. 
LYNNE:  And you know (Hx), 
 maybe that's another reason why she didn't really -- 
(H) maybe mom she kinda knew about all this stuff. 
And maybe that's why she didn't really, 
 pay that much attention to !Amanda. 
I mean no=t because, 
(H) I mean it seems like she'd pay more attention to her, 
but maybe it's because she wanted to have a little fun in her life too, 
and knew it wasn't gonna, 
(H) last forever for her. 
You know? 
 I mean, 
I guess like right before she died and stuff, 
she's like telling her mom like, 
 well if I go=, 
I want this here, 
and I want that there, 
and, 
 You know, 
just little things[=], 
LENORE: [Is !Amanda] her kid, 
or, 
LYNNE:  Yeah. 
LENORE: [Oh]. 
DORIS: [she had] a little three-year-old daughter.

 I just hope !Orville and !Genetta get that little girl. 
DORIS: Oh they won't. 
there's no -- 
LYNNE: Are they even [trying]? 
DORIS: [<X They can't X>] -- 
 They want her three months out of the year, 
but they have no legal grounds.

he is the legal father,

 there's not much they can do. 
LENORE: <X Oh X> she was divorced?

ROY:  So in principle, 
 the concept of nature, 
as a system inside of which man lives, 
 [is over]. 
PETE: [Mhm], 
 Right. 
ROY:  And then, 
 in practice, 
 since then, 
which was fifteen years ago, 
PETE:  mhm, 
ROY:  <MRC man has had such MRC> dramatic impact, 
 on  what we used to think of as nature, 
 (H) that, 
 (Hx) 
 that the only way to coexist with nature- -- 
It's no longer, 
 nature, 
 the quasi religious, 
 overarching, 
ordering principle,

MARILYN: [<X It's just X> it's a whole] different earth. 
ROY: can man[2kind2] spiritually survive,

absolutely nothing,

MARILYN:  What?

Is that what you were doing? 
MARILYN:  Yeah. 
PETE:  Yeah, 
 that's good. 
MARILYN: Perfect water, 
PETE: Unhunh. 
MARILYN:  actually, 
you know, 
I'd love to do gray water, 
PETE:  [Mhm]. 
MARILYN: [here], 
 but, 
ROY:  It's [illegal]. 
MARILYN: [it's illegal]. 
PETE:  Really. 
 How rude. 
MARILYN:  Isn't that [retarded]? 
ROY: [Isn't that weird]? 
PETE: (THROAT) 
 It is. 
 They just built a  a great big gray water processing center, 
 at the laundromat, 
$ HE SAYS "LAUNDRY MAT"? 
 in the .. complex where I live. 
MARILYN:  Oh. 
PETE: It's like right outside our back door. 
 There's all [these] huge machines and stuff, 
ROY: [<X Great m- X>] -- 
PETE: that like  filter it and all, 
and then it -- 
 They're going to like, 
 pump it into their .. watering system, 
for the  [apartment complex]. 
ROY: [Gray water systems] are local to, 
 I mean you get your own. 
 You don- -- 
It's not like a  big [system] some[2where2]. 
PETE: [Right]. 
[2Yeah2]. 
ROY: You get your own [3gray water3] system. 
PETE: [3Right3]. 
 Yeah. 
MARILYN: [Yeah, 
PETE: [But this is like] -- 
MARILYN: but  it's a] .. complex. 
PETE:  Right. 
 Cause, 
 this is this apartment complex, 
and there's the  laundromat, 
$ LAUNDRYMAT? 
 and they just  dump the water, 
 from that <X and everything X>. 
MARILYN:  <FOOD Well laundry's the best way, 
and showers. 
 I guess FOOD>. 
ROY:  The best way=, 
MARILYN:  To get gray water. 
PETE: Right. 
Well I would think you wouldn't want to, 
 <X think X> what might go down in the sink and stuff. 
MARILYN:  You wouldn't want to what? 
 Well, 
 I guess, 
 I guess it's more, 
that- -- 
 It's not that you don't want it on your lawn, 
it's that you don't want it sitting around. 
 [Before] it goes on your lawn. 
PETE: [Right]. 
 Right. 
MARILYN:  Stuff from . the sink. 
PETE:  Yeah. 
MARILYN:  Cause the stuff from the sink, 
would be great  for your lawn, 
[if it could] get right out there. 
PETE: [Right]. 
 Yeah, 
but then it would be sitting there, 
sort of  decomposing, 
or doing its thing all over the lawn, 
instead of in a nice little  compost pile. 
MARILYN: [Yeah]. 
PETE: [So that's], 
ROY: Well? 
 [2Mm=2], 
MARILYN: [2Well not if you were care2]ful. 
 I mean, 
 you know, 
if you -- 
if you -- 
 if you didn't have, 
 if you were really careful about your [dishes], 
PETE: [Right]. 
MARILYN: and [2scraped em2] off, 
PETE: [2Yeah2]. 
MARILYN: and it was [3just3]  X runoff. 
PETE: [3Mhm3]. 
Yeah. 
 <X Well X> that would be good. 
 Cause [all] of that stuff should go into the compost pile to begin with. 
MARILYN: [But] -- 
 Yeah. 
 (H) Actually, 
you know, 
 Zeke the sheik .. is a local. 
 You know, 
the guy whose compost pile blew up? 
PETE:  Oh no I don't know a[bout this]. 
MARILYN: [Didn't you hear] about him? 
PETE: [2No2]. 
MARILYN: [2It --

 And,

ROY: The grass clip[pings]. 
PETE: [Mhm].

MARILYN: [2Yeah2].

MARILYN: [4And he asked em4],

LENORE:  H[m]. 
ALINA: [how] they placed it, 
or if it was like, 
 like you said, 
number three four or five. 
 (H) Because they had such a b- hard time with it. 
Like last week's wasn't supposed to be shown, 
even though it was supposed to be number one, 
because it was so poorly done. 
 It had so much wrong with it. 
(H) ~Hector kept trying to get it corrected, 
like a month ago? 
 And they kept stopping him, 
stopping, 
stopping, 
stopping, 
stopping. 
LENORE:  (TSK) Cause of her. 
ALINA:  (TSK) Cause of her=, 
 cause of ~Ja=ke. 
 Nixon. 
He didn't want him to do it. 
 (H) And it makes him look like an idiot, 
 cause he's the director, 
and you can tell where he='s missed the shots. 
(H) Has n=othing whatsoever to do with anybody el=se. 
 It's ~Ja=ke. 
 But he'll s- -- 
He'd cut off his nose to spite his face. 
 That's s=tupid. 
 (H) So now ~Fletcher's starting to realize what's going on. 
(H) It's hard, 
 because, 
 the h=atchet man actually in the group is !Ed. 
 !Ed's the one that'll come in, 
 (TSK) and he'll go ahead and say, 
 (H) this is what needs to be done. 
 Okay, 
and h- -- 
or he'll look at you, 
and he'll go, 
<Q that was a s=tupid thing to do, 
why'd you do that Q>. 
 You know, 
makes the editor really stop and think. 
Or makes whoever it is stop and think, 
the director. 
(H)= But, 
 ~Fletcher'll kind of sit there and kind of go, 
<VOX we=ll,

Well,

 But, 
~Fletcher's having to learn how to be more assertive. 
Otherwise his show's just gonna go down the tubes. 
LENORE: Yeah[=].

 Now if i- --

ALICE:  Yep (Hx). 
 And he's rolling in it, 
~Mary. 
 And you know what the sad thing, 
 the thing that really scares me? 
 is that they're n=- --

ALICE:  Like I came over here to work with !Danae,

 I'm going to do some  translations for her and stuff? 
MARY:  Yeah. 
ALICE:  tonight? 
 [A=nd um], 
MARY: [(DRINK)] 
ALICE:  (THROAT) you know, 
 I have to make at least f=ifty [dollars or so], 
MARY: [(SWALLOW)] 
ALICE: to make it worth my time, 
 but like tonight (Hx), 
 well I called, 
 you know, 
this thing was going on with !Buck and everything, 
 so I called um, 
 ~Mandy's, 
 or, 
 I called our house, 
and ~Mandy answered the phone, 
and I said where's -- 
 you know where's -- 
 where -- 
Is !Ron there? 
And she said no. 
 (H)= When we were on our way to ~Tim's game, 
he was at Town Pump, 
and he asked what time  we'd be home, 
and we said probably about nine. 
 And she said then we went over to . your grandma's, 
but (H)= <X then X> we came back, 
and he wasn't here yet. 
 So=, 
 I called the Town Pump, 
and asked if he was still in the casino, 
 (H) course he wasn't (Hx), 
 he was on his way home. 
 And I said tell -- 
 So I called ~Mandy back, 
and I told her to, 
 have him call me. 
 when he got home. 
 So=, 
 I was in the bathtub when he called, 
 and I talked to him for a while and, 
 he went and, 
 he was really down about what . what I told .. h=im that ~Tim had said to me, 
 and how I was . so upset? 
 He goes <Q why didn't you tell him to go and wake me up Q>. 
 <@ I said I di=d @>, 
and he wouldn't do it. 
MARY:  Really=? 
ALICE: Mhm. 
 (TSK) He goes, 
they w- -- 
they were sitting around getting all  fucked up, 
he said but, 
 he said I went right to bed, 
he said I didn't get done working until after nine. 
MARY:  (TSK) Oh, 
ma=n. 
ALICE:  Cause that five-car pile up they had between Hardin and Crow? 
MARY:  Oh=, 
shit, 
really? 
I didn't hear about it. 
ALICE:  Yeah. 
 !Ron was s=inglehandedly there. 
 @  with one wrecker. 
MARY:  G- yeah=. 
ALICE:  (THROAT) 
MARY:  Seems like any time I've seen a wrecker out here, 
there's always two guys in there. 
ALICE: Hm-m X, 
@everyone was gone, 
when the call came in. 
MARY:  Oh=. 
ALICE: And !Jay's not supposed to go on those anymore, 
because of his heart, 
 (H) (TSK) so he had to send !Ron by himself, 
and !Ron was s=lowly pulling everybody out of the ditch. 
MARY:  Did they all hit each other? 
Or just, 
ALICE:  Kind of. 
 A%- a% semi  bumped a car, 
and then went and, 
 went on two wheels, 
and, 
 just about lost it, 
and then  (TSK) got back up on all . all its wheels again. 
MARY:  Oh=. 
 Did it land [in the ditch]? 
ALICE: [But it (Hx)]= -- 
 Kind of, 
it was able to get out, 
(H) but all the other cars that were  in the  direct ... vicinity, 
all hit the ditch. 
 And then, 
 there was three cars  and the semi. 
 (H) And then, 
 this uh, 
 this guy . pulled up and, 
MARY: (DRINK) 
ALICE:  he was going to uh, 
 (H)= !Peggy, 
MARY:  (SWALLOW) 
ALICE: (YAWN) (YAWN) you remember !Peggy !White? 
MARY:  (TSK) Yeah. 
ALICE: Her husband, 
!Gary !Bighare? 
MARY: Mhm? 
ALICE:  Him and her pulled up, 
and they were in the van? 
 And they stopped to ask !Ron what happened? 
 And here another car came and rear-ended em. 
MARY:  (TSK) (H) Oh=[=]. 
ALICE: [And they] ended up having to take um=  !Peggy !White . by helicopter to Billings. 
MARY:  Man that's pretty ba=d. 
ALICE:  I know. 
 Darn, 
 this darn dog keeps . breathing, 
<X and like X>  dreaming, 
<X you know X> I wonder if we should wake her up? 
MARY:  No, 
 she'll get scared and want to go outside. 
 Kinda nervous, 
you know. 
ALICE:  They say you can really . mess up a dog, 
by waking em up when they're dreaming. 
MARY:  Really? 
ALICE:  Mhm. 
 It's so cold outside, 
but yet sometimes she insists on staying out there. 
MARY: I know=. 
 You know what I was thinking of doing? 
ALICE: Hunh. 
MARY:  I don't know, 
she's kind of shy, 
but I was [wondering], 
ALICE: [(SNEEZE)] 
MARY:  [2what it2] would be like to . train her, 
ALICE: [2(SNIFF)2] 
MARY:  to pull a sled. 
ALICE:  I don't know if she'd do it. 
MARY:  I don't know if she would either. 
 She's kind of timid. 
ALICE:  Mhm. 
 She doesn't trust too many people at all. 
MARY:  Yeah=. 
ALICE:  (SNIFF) . (SWALLOW) Oh and you know another thing that ~Tim had the audacity to bitch about? 
MARY:  What. 
ALICE:  He said um, 
 ~Mandy had to stay up all by herself and decorate the tree. 
 until four in the morning. 
 And I even asked if we could put our ornaments on there, 
and they told me <X that X>  there wouldn't be enough room. 
MARY:  Really=? 
ALICE: Mhm, 
 ~Tim said that. 
MARY:  (TSK) (H) She was probably lonely when she was doing it, 
you know that? 
 She probably was. 
 [X] -- 
ALICE: [I] sat up with her, 
and I was talking to her, 
she was doing all the decorating, 
 I mean, 
(H)=  what was I gonna do. 
She- I mean, 
she was just  putting up the balls and everything and, 
 (H) she'd say <Q where, 
 where do you think this should go Q> and, 
 so I was sitting there doing my Welfare application. 
 And uh=, 
 @you @know I was just sitting there watching her, 
telling her  (H) where to put everything and what not. 
MARY:  Did you know !Nickie wanted her own tree=? 
ALICE:  Ye=s? 
MARY:  And I forgot to bring it in, 
it's outside? 
ALICE:  What are you gonna do with it. 
MARY:  She wants to set it up for her Barbies. 
 I was just gonna use a tin can and put rocks in the bottom? 
ALICE:  Mhm. 
MARY:  And just stick it in there. 
 (SWALLOW) (TSK) (H) And you know what I did? 
ALICE: Hm. 
MARY: I [didn't] want to waste a tree's life, 
ALICE: [(TSK)] 
MARY:  so I just cut a <@ branch off one @>. 
 (H) . God, 
<X I fell up there X>. 
 (DRINK) 
ALICE: Where'd you go. 
 to get em. 
MARY:  You know where !Sarah and !Arvela live? 
ALICE:  Mhm, 
MARY:  Just around the corner. 
 Remember that first  cattle guard you go over? 
ALICE:  Unhunh, 
MARY: I didn't even go over that. 
ALICE:  You mean, 
 kinda like  by the -- 
 by the [tunnel]? 
MARY: [Right below the] tunnel. 
ALICE:  Oh=. 
MARY:  And I just walked up -- 
 W=e just walked up around uh, 
that area, 
(H) God ~Alice that was f=u=n. 
ALICE: (H) Did you get grandma a tree too? 
MARY: Hunh-unh. 
ALICE:  Does she already have one? 
MARY:  Hm-m. 
 (TSK) That pickup could only hold like three. 
ALICE:  Mm. 
 I wonder why -- 
 Did daddy say to take the pickup back? 
Or what was the [deal]. 
MARY: [Yeah]. 
 Yeah. 
ALICE: Why. 
MARY:  Cause !Phoebe needs it. 
ALICE:  What's wrong with the car. 
 (H) 
MARY: Oh, 
you didn't hear about it? 
ALICE: Hunh-unh. 
MARY:  Oh, 
you did, 
about how the  engine was on fire? 
ALICE:  Mhm, 
MARY:  See there was oil spilling out, 
 leaking out from . the valve cover. 
ALICE:  Mhm. 
MARY: The valve cover gasket apparently cracked or whatever, 
and there was oil coming out, 
(H)  and the oil got hot, 
and you know how it gets hot and smokes? 
ALICE: Mhm. 
MARY:  Well, 
I guess enough came out, 
 because we were losing oil bad, 
 going from Billings to  Crow, 
um, 
 there's a lot of & 
ALICE: (DRINK) 
MARY: & smoke coming out, 
and by the time we got to Hardin, 
we had to put like uh=, 
 three or four quarts in. 
ALICE:  Unhunh. 
MARY:  It was three. 
 (H)= .. An=d (Hx), 
 by the time we got to & 
ALICE:  (H) 
MARY: & Crow, 
 it was=, 
 it was one quart low. 
 And there was smoke still coming from under the engine, 
I figure w- if it was losing that much oil, 
(H) then <X it X> caught fire. 
ALICE: Mhm. 
MARY: Cause the engine was hot, 
cause there wasn't  enough water in the  radiator. 
ALICE:  Mhm. 
MARY: (TSK) I talked to !Oscar about it, 
and he said, 
(H) well I checked, 
it was only, 
 it was only about, 
I'd say a half a quart to a quart short of water. 
 But that shouldn't make any difference. 
He goes the only thing I can think of, 
(H) is that there was an air lock in there. 
ALICE: [(THROAT)] 
MARY:  [And that] running the engine out on the open road? 
ALICE:  Mh[2m2]. 
MARY: [2C2]aused that air lock to come through. 
 [3flushed it out3]. 
ALICE: [3And bust th3]e  gasket? 
MARY:  No=, 
 it would more or less um, 
 the engine wasn't being kept cool enough. 
 Cause there [wasn't enough] fluid  in the radiator. 
ALICE: [(DRINK)] 
Unhunh, 
MARY:  And, 
you know how the radiator's, 
the pipe's close to other parts of the en[gine]? 
ALICE: [Yeah]=. 
 So what & 
MARY: It was some [part in there]. 
ALICE: & [caused the f]ire. 
MARY:  The engine being too hot, 
 and the oil leaking, 
ALICE:  So he knew that the oil was leaking? 
MARY: No, 
 (TSK) we knew we were losing oil, 
but we didn't know where. 
I just figured it was from= that valve cover gasket. 
 Just from lifting up the hood and looking at it. 
ALICE:  (H) So what's he gonna do. 
MARY:  Well, 
 %and two of his wires, 
the sparkplug wires? 
ALICE:  Unh[unh]. 
MARY: [were] fried all the way through. 
ALICE:  Unhunh. 
MARY:  So we took those off and we, 
 replaced them with some old ones out of the garage. 
ALICE:  I knew tha=t. 
MARY: And it runs. 
 It runs. 
There's enough uh=, 
 radiator fluid in there. 
ALICE:  Mhm. 
MARY:  so that it will, 
 It's  it's enough. 
ALICE:  Mhm. 
MARY:  (DRINK) But I think running it out on the open road, 
will cause it  possibly to shoot more oil out. 
ALICE:  Mhm. 
MARY: That valve cover gasket has to be replaced. 
ALICE:  Hm. 
 (Hx) 
MARY:  I don't know. 
(H) Oh I freaked !Cookie and, 
 !Rita and, 
 !Gary out tonight. 
 Remember the Plain-  Plainfeather uh .. Claypit? 
 where that red clay is? 
ALICE:  Mhm. 
MARY:  Right there. 
 I saw my  my speedometer just go Brr=. 
 like that just dow=n. 
(H) You know, 
and I knew exactly what it was. 
 What I have to do, 
is take off the distributor wire, 
and splice it in with the fuel pump wire. 
ALICE:  [Mhm]. 
MARY: [Because] my=  fuel pump is now electric, 
 Never used to be. 
ALICE:  Mhm. 
MARY:  Hand me that ashtray. 
 Or your light, 
I mean. 
 <P Your light P>. 
 (H) It's behind the sewing machine. 
(H) 
ALICE: (THROAT) 
MARY: And uh=, 
 sometimes it gets loose. 
ALICE:  (YAWN) 
MARY: And  no more <HI fuel HI>. 
ALICE: (YAWN0 Unhunh, 
MARY: So I stopped the car, 
and they said what are you doing. 
I said, 
<Q oh, 
I gotta tighten this wire here Q>. 
 (H) . So I had !Cookie .. turn on the ignition and turn it off. 
 So, 
 cause see, 
once you turn that key on, 
 then you hear the%, 
 the fuel pump .. come on. 
ALICE:  Mhm. 
MARY:  And if the wire's not connected right, 
 it doesn't come on. 
ALICE:  Mhm. 
MARY:  So I did that, 
 and I lit a match to find out where I was, 
and, 
 n- after everything was hunky-dory, 
 then I, 
 shut the hood, 
and got back in, 
and I started up the engine and, 
(H) both !Gary and !Rita were sitting on the edges of their seat. 
 (SWALLOW) And I turned around and I looked, 
 and I said, 
 <Q did I scare you kids Q>? 
 (H) They wouldn't say anything, 
then !Gary goes, 
 (H) .. <Q yeah, 
I was scared Q>. 
@@@ 
ALICE: (H) 
MARY:  (H) 
ALICE: (Hx) 
Mary:  <X But X> I freaked em out, 
 I don't know. 
 Then daddy said something about the steering column on my car needing ((MATCH_STRIKE))_work? 
ALICE:  Mhm, 
MARY:  Said long as I don't drive it fast, 
it should be alright. 
 But oh man I don't know. 
 See the thing about it is, 
 if I go after !Ken, 
I'm not really gonna have any money. 
ALICE:  Mhm, 
MARY:  to um=, 
 you know, 
<HI do things HI>. 
 (SWALLOW) I'm not saying I'm gonna . (TSK) pay for everything, 
but, 
 I don't want to be broke= around him.

MARY: [2and go2] do something. 
ALICE:  (H) I don't think it's such a good idea for you to go up there in the winter. 
MARY:  (TSK) Mm=. 
 I've been thinking about that. 
ALICE: (SWALLOW)  We should all get some money together and, 
 is there any way he could [like,

ALICE: meet us in Great Falls] or something? 
 Cause I'd like to go up there and go to the,

 (TSK) work out, 
 like if she had to go shopping or something maybe you could go with her, 
and help her with him? 
 And !Nicky helps her  with him a lot anyway.\000000000 000000000 MARY: 1182.90 1186.92 ... And then of course he [adores] me. 
ALICE: [(Hx)] 
 Mhm. 
MARY:  (H) I remember I was pregnant with !Nicky. 
 (SWALLOW) And uh=, 
!Boots's little boy, 
 he really liked me.

ALICE: Mhm. 
MARY:  % You know how it is when we're pregnant,

ALICE: Mhm. 
MARY:  (TSK) (H) I'd fall asleep on the couch,

ALICE:  Mhm.

 And I remember he would -- 
 I woke up, 
and here he was gone, 
his mother carried him in the other room, 
ALICE:  @Mhm.

 Twin girls. 
ALICE:  (COUGH COUGH)

 sibling rivalry. 
ALICE: (Hx) 
MARY:  But I don't know, 
 she's six years old now. 
 And they say that if there's six years between children, 
there's not that much rivalry. 
ALICE:  After four there's almost none. 
MARY:  Really? 
ALICE:  Mhm. 
MARY:  [Cause they're], 
ALICE: [Four is i]deal. 
MARY:  they're kind of in different worlds,

!Trace will be, 
 the next time I have a baby, 
 !Trace will probably be=, 
 about three? 
 four? 
MARY:  Hm. 
ALICE:  That's when I'm gonna get this shit taken out. 
MARY: (TSK) (H) 
ALICE:  (H) !Tammy !Kashen has one of these too. 
MARY:  What is it. 
ALICE:  Norplant? 
MARY:  Oh really. 
ALICE:  !Deon told me. 
 Cause I asked him what . his intentions were with her. 
 Cause I told him I thought he was too young to be . so involved. 
MARY:  (H)= . !Gwen was telling me that, 
 Did she talk to you lately? 
ALICE: Hm-m. 
MARY:  They had a cyst on her ovary. 
 And they had to go in and take it out? 
ALICE:  Mhm. 
MARY:  Take out that cyst? 
ALICE: [Mhm]. 
MARY: [(H)]  (SWALLOW) And it's really screwed up her uh, 
ALICE:  menstrual p- --

 and then she goes, 
 <Q so tell --

And she really laughed. 
ALICE: (H) (Hx) 
MARY:  (TSK) I don't know if !Tammy would be too happy with that though. 
 (SWALLOW) Seems to me that she's trying to straighten herself out, 
and, 
 pursue a family. 
ALICE:  Tammy? 
MARY:  (TSK) What do you think. 
ALICE:  I don't know (Hx). 
MARY:  (TSK) Or do you think it might be a matter of convenience. 
ALICE:  I think it's a convenience for both of em.

and then I didn't and I  kept making like, 
 <Q s= uh= (Hx)  <WH you know like WH> (Hx)= Q>, 
you know like [<Q I know what you're Q>] -- 
REBECCA: [He was ma]king noi[2ses like2] that? 
RICKIE: [2(H)2] 
No=, 
he was making those=, 
 you know, 
the rattling p[aper], 
REBECCA: [Unhunh]. 
RICKIE: but I was making noises like, 
<Q (TSK)(Hx)= Q> 
you know like, 
I wanted him to know, 
<Q I know what you're doing Q>. 
REBECCA: [Yeah]. 
RICKIE: [You know] I remembered him for a year -- 
 from a year ago. 
(H) And so, 
then I just <VOX kept, 
you know I just turned VOX>, 
you know, 
away from him, 
and I looked in the window, 
(H) and  he just kept <<B +hitting the paper +. 
 like that, 
 + B>> you kno=w? 
<VOX But you know what he wa[s do]ing VOX>. 
REBECCA: [Yeah]. 
RICKIE: @ (H) He kept hitting the paper, 
(H) and um, 
 uh=, 
let me see, 
then one time I jus=t, 
you know, 
kinda  looked over=, 
(H) and then you can see it. 
 You know= (Hx), 
 you can see it. 
REBECCA:  Had he l=ifted up the paper in any way, 
or, 
RICKIE:  Yeah, 
just like, 
 ((CLAP)) you know, 
I'm trying to see how a paper goes, 
likes thi-, 
REBECCA: Like this. 
RICKIE:  %Okay, 
 %%%, 
 like, 
he has the paper like, 
 like thi=s, 
 just like, 
 you know, 
moves it. 
Like that. 
 You know, 
[like that. 
REBECCA: [Oh=], 
RICKIE: You] know= and you can see it. 
REBECCA: Okay. 
RICKIE: You know? 
REBECCA: Was he looking at you at [all during that time]. 
RICKIE: [Ye=s. 
The] <MRC who=le  enti=re .. ti=me MRC>. 
REBECCA: Okay. 
RICKIE: I mean, 
(H) not looking, 
(H) at <<PAPER first he would go like this, 
even, 
 with the paper. 
 And look at me. 
 You know, 
trying to get my attention PAPER>>. 
REBECCA: Yeah[=]. 
RICKIE: [Like] he= wanted me to look at him. 
And, 
 (H) then the whole time under here, 
he'd just look. 
 I mean, 
 %% he looked so hard, 
that it was like burning, 
@[@@ you] know what I mean? 
REBECCA: [Yeah]. 
RICKIE: It- -- 
[(H)] 
REBECCA: [Tell] the jury that. 
RICKIE: Okay[2= (Hx)2]. 
REBECCA: [2That's2] -- 
 I mean [3that's gr3]eat. 
RICKIE: [3He just3], 
 alright. 
[%] -- 
REBECCA: [U=m], 
Because that's what he does. 
RICKIE: [Okay]. 
REBECCA: [And that's] his way, 
(H)= of drawing your attention to [2him, 
RICKIE: [2Mhm2]. 
REBECCA: bec2]ause, 
 if somebody's doing that to you, 
 there's no way you're gonna, 
 you know, 
 just totally ignore them, 
RICKIE: [Yeah]. 
REBECCA: [cause] you're always going to [2wanna2] keep (H) them in your peripheral vision, 
RICKIE: [2(SNIFF)2] 
REBECCA: at [3least3]. 
RICKIE: [3Yeah3]. 
ARNOLD: [3M3][4hm4]. 
REBECCA: [4to ma4][5ke sure5]  wh=ere they a[6re6]. 
RICKIE: [5Mhm5]. 
[6Yeah6]=. 
Cause I was, 
you know, 
I didn't know what he was gonna @do, 
REBECCA: [Yeah], 
RICKIE: [or any]thing, 
so[2= (H)2], 
REBECCA: [2so=2], 
um-, 
part of our burden is to prove, 
that he's deliberately doing th-, 
that he has the specific intent to draw your atten[tion to] him. 
RICKIE: [Okay]. 
REBECCA:  (H) So let them know that [2he was do2]ing that. 
RICKIE: [2Okay2]. 
 Alright. 
REBECCA:  U=m, 
 okay. 
So then, 
 and then, 
 he sort of pulled the paper aside, 
and [he's still] staring [2at you2], 
RICKIE: [Yeah]. 
[2Unhunh sti2]ll sta=ring and, 
 (H) just, 
you know, 
 and the=n, 
 but when uh uh=, 
 like you come to a stop, 
see that's all through the tunnel. 
 (H) You know, 
that's a long, 
 like [about], 
REBECCA: [Mhm]. 
RICKIE:  five minute ride or something? 
A couple of minutes ride, 
(H) and we got t=o like Embarcadero, 
(H) <<PAPER he would just, 
you know, 
go like this, 
you know PAPER>>, 
before anyone got on, 
and wait, 
and then just do the same thing, 
<X until X> I had to get off at my stop. 
REBECCA:  (TSK)(H) Tell .. the jury about that too, 
be[cause] tha=t indicates that he knew what he was doing was wro[2=ng2], 
RICKIE: [Hm]. 
[2Oh2] okay. 
REBECCA: and if there was a chance that any man  might w[3alk by3], 
RICKIE: [3y%- -- 
Mhm3]. 
REBECCA: (H) You know, 
I had another case, 
or, 
 I have a .. pr- report from another case where, 
(H)= u=m, 
 he wa- -- 
he was crouched down, 
[and] doing it, 
RICKIE: [Mhm]. 
REBECCA: and then when  a man would walk by, 
he'd sit up, 
RICKIE: [Yeah]. 
REBECCA: [(H)] And, 
 you know, 
do nothing, 
and then once the man was through the doors, 
then he'd go back [X X] doing it. 
RICKIE: [Yea=h]. 
 Okay. 
REBECCA:  So. 
 (H)= U=m, 
 o[kay so then] you got off, 
RICKIE: [(H) (Hx)=] 
REBECCA:  at your stop. 
RICKIE: Yeah=. 
REBECCA: (H) U=m, 
and  how were you feeling. 
RICKIE:  We=ll (Hx), 
<P<X it was like X>P> (Hx), 
 <CRY s=- I don't know, 
 sorry, 
(H)= 
ARNOLD:  <X You X> doing alright, 
RICKIE:  (SNIFF) just, 
I don't know, 
like disgusted, 
 you know, 
wh-, 
 why I really wanted to report it this time because, 
(SOB) it was like summertime? 
[(SOB)] 
REBECCA: [Unhunh], 
RICKIE: and the kids? 
 You know the kids and [every]thing, 
REBECCA: [Yeah]. 
RICKIE: that's what I was scared of, 
because I know how, 
uh I was, 
you know, 
a victim of, 
 you know, 
abuse like that or <X % X>, 
(SOB) (SNIFF) I just, 
you know, 
I just, 
 That's what I was think-, 
the very first time I reported, 
it was just like this  dirty old ma=n, 
just that tha[=t, 
REBECCA: [Yeah]. 
RICKIE: (SNIFF)]= And this time, 
it was during the summer and there was lots= of ki=ds, 
(SNIFF) and um, 
 I just felt like, 
 you know, 
upset. 
You know, 
REBECCA: Yeah. 
RICKIE:  and I jus=t, 
you know, 
 (SNIFF) .. I just felt upset. 
REBECCA:  Okay. 
RICKIE: You know, 
 [n- CRY>] -- 
REBECCA: [Tell] the jury that. 
 Um, 
it's  it's [real]ly important that they understand, 
RICKIE: [(SNIFF)] 
REBECCA:  the feelings that go through you when sombody does something [like] that to you, 
RICKIE: [%%] 
REBECCA: cau[se, 
RICKIE: [(SNIFF)] 
REBECCA: (H)] my one concern about this case  i=s, 
(H) u=m, 
 that  some people may have [the a]ttitude of, 
RICKIE: [(SNIFF)] 
REBECCA: <Q well, 
 he never touched you, 
RICKIE: Mhm. 
REBECCA:  he didn't .. make any verbal threats to you, 
(H) it's no [big] deal Q>. 
RICKIE: [(SNIFF)] 
REBECCA:  (H) A=nd, 
especially, 
 I have some .. young single men, 
 on my jury panel. 
RICKIE: [Mhm], 
REBECCA: [(H)] A=nd, 
 % I% -- 
 my .. worry is that they don't .. relate to what a woman feels, 
 whe[n so]mething like that is happening, 
RICKIE: [Mhm]. 
REBECCA: because their experience would be totally different. 
(H) if a man exposes [himself], 
RICKIE: [(SNIFF)] 
REBECCA: which, 
 a man would never do that. 
RICKIE: [Mhm]. 
REBECCA: [Becau]se, 
RICKIE: [2(SNIFF)2] 
REBECCA: [2(H)2] number one they pick out, 
 I think .. more vulnerable peo[ple. 
RICKIE: [Mhm]. 
REBECCA: (H)] But if, 
 u=m, 
 a ma=n  were to be exposed to, 
they would  laugh, 
 or, 
 you know, 
be disgusted, 
RICKIE: [Mhm]. 
REBECCA: [(H)] or be mad, 
(H) but they would[2n't ne2]cessari[3ly feel3], 
RICKIE: [2(SNIFF)2] 
JUNE: [3((KNOCK_KNOCK3]_KNOCK)) 
REBECCA:  scared .. [or threat]ened, 
>ENV: [((DOOR_OPENS))] 
RICKIE: Unhunh, 
JUNE:  Hi[=], 
REBECCA: [H]i. 
JUNE: Can I sit with you? 
REBECCA: Sure. 
(H)= U=m, 
so r-  relate that information to [the jury]. 
>ENV: [((DOOR_CLOSES))] 
RICKIE: Okay. 
REBECCA: Okay. 
(H)  U=m, 
 (TSK)  and then, 
 uh, 
so then when you got off, 
you called  the poli[ce. 
RICKIE: [No]. 
REBECCA: Right]? 
RICKIE: I went upstairs to the BART, 
and told them, 
and I tried to tell them what train it was, 
(H)= an=d I just, 
(H)  I was still kind of like shocked, 
so I %I was like, 
<Q well I have to go, 
cause I have to make an appointment Q>, 
but I di=d tell someone, 
I said I'll be back to make a report or whatever I had to do, 
(H)= and then there was a different person down there, 
and, 
 when I called the BART police, 
they said <Q oh no one's even said anything to us Q>, 
you know [and uh], 
REBECCA: [Yeah]. 
RICKIE: (SNIFF) That was that, 
and then I think, 
uh=, 
 couple of days after, 
 one of the uh, 
 detectives, 
(H) called me and then I made a report. 
He wanted to see if I can ID him first, 
and then, 
 we just made a report and he said, 
 he'll submit it and everything. 
REBECCA: Okay. 
 a[nd y]ou ID'ed him immediately. 
RICKIE: [(SNIFF)] 
Unhunh, 
he just showed me. 
He's all <Q okay, 
come with me, 
come with me Q>, 
you [know], 
REBECCA: [Okay]. 
 (H) Alright. 
I have %, 
 a- and this is, 
i- if they make an issue out of it, 
this is what you looked at. 
[Right]? 
RICKIE: [M]hm=, 
REBECCA: Like a folder with different, 
RICKIE: Yeah=, 
yeah,

Okay.

RICKIE: Alright. 
REBECCA: U=m,

 it'll be higher. 
 if he's convicted. 
RICKIE:  Okay[=]. 
REBECCA: [So], 
plus he's got your case pending  in .. [2Oakland2],

REBECCA: he'll be able to a2]sk you questions also. 
(H) He's, 
 he's a very polite guy. 
RICKIE: Okay. 
REBECCA: (H) He's a young  attorney, 
(H) u=m, 
he's with the public defender's office, 
 he's, 
 (H) u=m, 
 w%- when we had the case the last time, 
 it was a different attorney. 
RICKIE: [Mhm]. 
REBECCA: [And th]at attorney  terrorized my, 
 my one victim that I put on, 
(H) u=m, 
 he  walked up to her, 
and he was about this  far away [from her], 
RICKIE: [Mhm]. 
REBECCA: and, 
(H) sh- -- 
cause she had testified, 
 when he walked in initially and he looked at me, 
 <PAR ~Walter ~Munson PAR>, 
 she said, 
(H) I  I  knew he was a pervert, 
 just by the way he looked at me. 
RICKIE: Oh=[=]. 
REBECCA: [(H)] So this man walked up to him and he said, 
<Q I'm standing close to you, 
I'm looking at you, 
does that make me a pervert Q>? 
RICKIE: Mhm. 
REBECCA: (H) A=nd, 
 uh, 
 just badgered her, 
RICKIE: A[w=]. 
REBECCA: [but thi]s  this attorney [2is not2] like that at all. 
RICKIE: [2(SNIFF)2] 
[3<P Okay P>3]. 
REBECCA: [3He'll be3] very polite, 
(H)[4=4] u=m, 
RICKIE: [4<WH Mhm WH>4], 
REBECCA:  (TSK) he's going to try and focus more on, 
(H)  uh=, 
 discrepancies, 
like if you testify to one thing, 
and there's something written differently in the report. 
RICKIE: Unhunh. 
REBECCA: He might say well=, 
 you know, 
 in [your], 
RICKIE: [(SNIFF)] 
REBECCA: in the report it says that you=, 
 um=, 
 you know, 
 he sat dow=n, 
 right across from you, 
RICKIE: [Mhm]. 
REBECCA: [imm]ediately. 
RICKIE: [2Oh okay2]. 
REBECCA: [2as opposed to wal2]king, 
or some[3thing like3] that. 
RICKIE: [3Okay3]. 
REBECCA: which it doesn't but, 
RICKIE: [Okay]. 
REBECCA: [(H)] u=m, 
he's gonna try and focus on little things, 
cause that's all he can do. 
RICKIE: [Okay]. 
REBECCA: [(H)] But, 
RICKIE: [2(SNIFF)2] 
REBECCA: [2for the2] most part he'll be  polite .. and gentle. 
RICKIE: Okay. 
REBECCA:  So you don't have to worry about him. 
RICKIE:  Hm. 
REBECCA: (H) U=m, 
 (TSK) . what hap- -- 
well tell me about the  year ago incident. 
RICKIE:  U=m, 
 that one was at night time. 
 And, 
um, 
I was working la=te, 
and it was around, 
 (H) I remember I used to get off ar- around nine, 
and I used to get to um, 
 (H) the Bart station around ten o'clock? 
 A=nd, 
 he would be= %, 
 I think, 
 <P I'm trying to think, 
would he get o=n, 
or would he already be on P>. 
(H) Well that's the Daly City one, 
so he would  get on, 
 when I would get on,

KATHY:  (H) But then, 
I didn't get what she got. 
 I guess she -- 
Yeah, 
you can <X put it X> so. 
 <X<WH square root of that WH>X> -- 
 Oh no, 
it's not gonna work that way. 
You don't have it in the middle. 
 See I put it in the middle? 
(H)  Seven .. halves, 
is greater than or equal to- -- 
(H) But you can't put it in the middle, 
cause if it's  gonna be g- -- 
 (Hx) (H) Yeah if it's gonna be greater than that, 
then it's not gonna be less= than that. 
 Well I guess it can. 
NATHAN:  (H)  <WH God WH>. 
 (H) So one way I [could do it (Hx)]. 
KATHY: [(H) Well s- -- 
 No=]. 
Wait a minute now. 
See, 
l- look what she di=d. 
 (H) She u=m, 
 flipped that sign over. 
 <X But X>, 
 uh, 
 when she- %you divide by negative two, 
you have to flip all the signs over. 
 which you k- did. 
 Yeah, 
cause you got that right, 
 [it's right here]. 
NATHAN: [(H)] Oh go=sh. 
 (H) You know what, 
 I'm just gonna skip this one. 
KATHY:  No you're not, 
 you're gonna do it. 
 Now. 
NATHAN:  So I can't start by d- -- 
KATHY:  (H) Unh-unh. 
 Not finding a common denominator. 
You have to ha- bring, 
NATHAN: Well I can do -- 
find one side by doing that, 
can't I? 
KATHY:  Yeah but, 
why don't you p-  just put the other -- 
 put -- 
 (H) once you have n=egative two-thirds on the other side, 
then you can find a common denom- f- na- -- 
buh buh buh buh, 
 (H) common denominator for the whole thing, 
and it's gonna be the same  denominat[or]. 
NATHAN: [Well] what's the common denominator of bluh bluh bluh bluh [2bluh bluh bluh=.

 (H) I don't ever remember us doing anything like that though. 
<Q Well add it onto the other side Q>. 
 (H) There's like a way you always can get rid of those absolute value bars. 
 in problems, 
isn't there? 
 <X Hey X>. 
 Can I u=se some of this? 
KATHY:  (H) Oh. 
Yeah. 
 %_Mm. 
 (TSK) See, 
 yeah. 
(H)  Here it's absolute values. 
 Right here. 
NATHAN: (H) (TSK) And it's doing it the way that you were doing it? 
KATHY:  I'm trying to find one l=ike tha=t @one. 
NATHAN:  @ (H) See that's the problem, 
there's so many different ty=pes. 
 (H) That, 
 I'm sitting here st- worrying about this one right here, 
and there probably won't even be l- one like this on the test. 
KATHY:  I know. 
NATHAN:  There'll be a different one. 
KATHY:  (H) So what do you do. 
 You find a inequality, 
 with . an absolute value in it which, 
(H) there's one right there. 
 Mhm. 
 See? 
 I sure didn't see any in the -- 
NATHAN:  examples. 
KATHY:  Hm-m. 
 (TSK) . See? 
 There's no -- 
 (TSK) [There it is. 
NATHAN: [(H)= (THROAT)]

 you brought,

NATHAN:  <P O=kay= . (SWALLOW) P>. 
KATHY:  And [all that] -- 
NATHAN: [See that] just proves that she puts problems on there that we've never go=ne over. 
 I know we've never done one like that. 
 where you do that, 
 (H) Can you -- 
Do you wanna do that when it's less than, 
or can you do that when it's greater than too. 
KATHY:  Yeah. 
 Th- -- 
Either way. 
NATHAN:  So if it's pointed this way, 
you just put another one pointing this way over here,

back to the [ the] first thing, 
BRAD: [Okay].

BRAD: [2Yeah2], 
PHIL: (H)= 
BRAD: I've gotta pick up [!Pat,

I dropped her off at the bookkeeper, 
PHIL: <<WRITING 
BRAD: (H) Uh, 
PHIL:  (TSK) Uh I would prefer that WRITING>>, 
that you were there % on one hand, 
because I think that it would be most expedient. 
But I think, 
(H)  what was .. f=elt, 
was that at this point, 
rather than ha- -- 
than create (H) -- 
 (TSK) I don't really f=- find it to be, 
 you know, 
 a=  confrontation, 
by any means, 
but, 
 (H) 
BRAD: [Mhm]. 
PHIL: [I just] think, 
 they wanna be able to just kind of .. %  figure out, 
I think our board eh, 
 quite frankly we have more . problems to resolve interior, 
than we do  (H) (TSK) outside of it. 
BRAD:  [Hm]. 
PHIL: [I think] most of it is just attitudes. 
BRAD: [2Hm2]. 
PHIL: [2(H)=2]  I think, 
%  you know, 
like I said, 
what we need to do, 
is this board has to realize, 
 in my opinion that, 
 that they have to come to grips with, 
(H) the fact that they are responsible, 
 for basically what they've created. 
BRAD: [Mhm]. 
PHIL: [Okay], 
You know, 
(H)[= 
BRAD: [Mhm]. 
PHIL: You] can't th- penalize some[2body for  m-2] --

BRAD: well it was far beyond our [4control.

BRAD: (H) That uh4], 
PHIL: we're4] we're a different board. 
 [5We are not the5] same. 
BRAD: [5Yeah5]. 
PHIL: [6And we have to do that6], 
BRAD: [6(H) That's right6]. 
PHIL: but we have to realize that there's, 
(H) the faults here, 
 we have to claim responsibilities. 
(H) [I mean], 
BRAD: [Mhm]. 
PHIL: I think there was, 
 there's manners of- of speaking that I was very outspoken about, 
at this meeting, 
you know, 
w- that I talked  to (H) .. uh !Bill and !Carmela and !Nancy about, 
 you know, 
and they -- 
X -- 
we did -- 
they asked me to meet with them about  !Teresa's thing. 
BRAD:  [Mhm]. 
PHIL: [(H)] 
 that  I find v- really, 
 nothing, 
 to be honest, 
 nothing of any [validity. 
BRAD: [(H) Well I -- 
you know],

BRAD: I have spoken [2twice with2] !Teresa.

 [3Unhunh3]. 
BRAD: [3Yeah3]. 
PHIL:  (H)[4=4] 
BRAD: [4And I told her4] exactly --

(H) anyway, 
we --

(H) uh=,

that it would probably, 
be brought up, 
at b=oard retreat, 
or, 
D_I don't know. 
[ Uh -- 
PHIL: [(H) Well I -- 
I'm gonna write a letter to !Teresa,

 d- Thank you for your l- --

you know, 
I'm hoping, 
we are gonna address  this .. letter of concerns that you've given us. 
[(H)]= 
BRAD: [Mhm]. 
PHIL:  Um= (Hx), 
she's asked (Hx) that,

she want- -- 
she didn't really want her things to be kind of everywhere.

 [3(H)3] 
BRAD: [3Yeah3]. 
PHIL:  Um, 
!Teresa is a very sensitive person, 
 she f- -- 
 you know, 
%  I don't -- 
I have no doubt that she believes, 
 what happened happened. 
(H) [But], 
BRAD: [(H)] Well but, 
PHIL: My-  my feeling is, 
 as I told them, 
I said, 
(H) if it's that issue, 
 I says, 
 you know, 
 I said let's just get real here. 
 I [said], 
BRAD: [Yeah]. 
PHIL: we all know ~Brad, 
 (H) I said, 
we all know !Teresa, 
I said, 
and I don't know anybody on this board who does not tiptoe around !Teresa. 
 [Period]. 
BRAD: [Yeah]. 
 [2Unhunh2]. 
PHIL: [2(H)2] 
I says, 
I don't know anybody who would even go as far as to say  anything of that nature, 
 I said, 
(H)= a=nd, 
 there- -- 
it was very clear. 
You know. 
 She= kept saying, 
 prefacing everything with, 
(H)  you know, 
this is no=t a personal attack. 
 [This is no=t] a personal [2(H) .. vendetta, 
BRAD: [@Yeah], 
[2yeah= yeah yeah. 
Right. 
Right2]. 
PHIL: (H)2]  Which tells you, 
 that it is. 
BRAD: Yeah. 
PHIL: That's immediately what it said. 
[And that's] what every[2body perceived it. 
BRAD: [Yeah]. 
[2(H)  There -- 
PHIL: (H)2] 
BRAD: Yeah, 
there have been some2] uh, 
 I'll te- -- 
well it goes back to, 
if you can believe it I ha- -- 
(H) I know  she -- 
there was a  a -- 
 We had a number of people .. once, 
at a party, 
(H) uh, 
like half of the board- -- 
<@ it was a [big mistake @>] of mine, 
PHIL: [Yeah]. 
BRAD: (H) and I know, 
 she felt really snubbed, 
a=nd [uh], 
PHIL: [Mhm]? 
BRAD: (H) and it was -- 
and I- I called her in fact, 
later. 
And I said !Teresa. 
(H) Thi-  this was not a w- -- 
I invited people that helped with the market that  [year, 
PHIL: [Mhm]? 
I think] it was two years ago, 
(H) And I know, 
 I mean that wa- really upset her. 
 And jeez. 
If that's gonna upset her, 
(H)[= Uh, 
PHIL: [(TSK) (H) Well that's  that's the thing that], 
BRAD: (H) but anyway]. 
PHIL: that see and the other thing that I've gotta do, 
too, 
is I wanna make sure, 
like, 
for example, 
(H)  !Donna's awa=re that she= is not gonna be at this retreat. 
BRAD: M[hm]. 
PHIL: [See I] have not called her, 
 [2but I'm gonna call her2] to tell her  that. 
BRAD: [2Mhm2]. 
Yeah. 
PHIL: You know, 
we're having a board retreat. 
 you [know, 
BRAD: [R=ight]. 
that it's not] gonna include staff, 
if that's what we [2decide. 
BRAD: [2Right2]. 
 Unhunh2]. 
PHIL: (H)2]  And what we will do (Hx), 
is I think, 
 what we're gonna probably wanna do, 
or what I would like to do, 
is I would like to take a day. 
BRAD: M[hm]. 
PHIL: [(H)]=  %d=- during the week, 
and we'll just take a whole day. 
 That day. 
An=d myself, 
(H) uh, 
if we have a uh= facilitator, 
BRAD:  Mhm. 
PHIL: (H)= U=m, 
that that person, 
you and !Patricia and  %!D= !Donna, 
BRAD:  Mhm, 
PHIL: and maybe one other, 
or two other board members would, 
 actually spend that day and just say okay, 
this is what went on at that [retreat]. 
BRAD: [Mhm]. 
PHIL: (H)= These <X are the X> con[2cer=ns2], 
BRAD: [2Yeah2]. 
PHIL: (H)  These were comments, 
 %= these are the ones that we feel we can address. 
 [These are the ones that] pertain to you. 
BRAD: [Unhunh], 
 [2Yeah. 
PHIL: [2(H)= %=2] 
BRAD: (H)2] I- I am concerned ~Phil that, 
(H)=  you mentioned it yesterday. 
That  that there @may be  a number of questions, 
 that  just cannot be answered. 
 Without  [me] ... being there.

uh=,

she's gonna start walking back to the office. 
PHIL: [Yeah. 
BRAD: [(H) I dropped her at the bookkeeper]. 
PHIL:  W- .. w- .. why don't you] call me, 
at least a little bit later [2maybe, 
BRAD: [2Yeah2]. 
PHIL: and2] we can [3<X go X> do that3]. 
BRAD: [3Can I3] do that, 
(H) Cause I -- 
 she'll be -- 
PHIL: [(Hx) !Ji-  !Jim and I are gonna] have lunch,

 [3Yeah. 
PHIL: [3(H)=  u=m3], 
BRAD:  you wanna do it, 
where3] -- 
 what's the -- 
PHIL: I % -- 
you know, 
I don't -- 
my- my feeling is, 
I'm trying to, 
 I think, 
(H)  what I wanna do, 
is -- 
 my- my  point of wanting to push this retreat, 
I think it was really important was, 
BRAD: M[hm], 
PHIL: [to] do it to e- -- 
 (H) .. to make it sound like we're taking it seriously. 
BRAD:  [Oh= yeah=]. 
PHIL: [But  to] also  put into perspective, 
and see, 
w- [that was one] point of view why, 
BRAD: [Yeah=]. 
PHIL: you know, 
Like I said d- d- the facilitator, 
in in the beginning, 
I did not -- 
 wasn't really in support of one. 
And only because [I felt], 
BRAD: [Mhm]. 
PHIL: (H) I wanna make it [2sound important, 
BRAD: [2It would formalize it too much? 
Or 2], 
PHIL:  (H) I want--- 
it2] formalizing it, 
but it's also say- -- 
I want it to come to the resolution that, 
 things aren't that ba=d. 
BRAD: Mhm. 
 (TSK) (H) [No. 
PHIL: [<% and that what %>] -- 
BRAD: I] -- 
PHIL: what we -- 
and things aren't that bad. 
[The thing is] that we h- do have our attitudes. 
BRAD: [Mhm]. 
[2Mhm2]. 
PHIL: [2(H)=2] Okay, 
BRAD: [3Mhm3]. 
PHIL: [3 We have an3] attitude, 
you know, 
even what !Ray's attitude with  with !Barbara. 
BRAD:  [Mhm]. 
PHIL: [(H)] is completely  unheard of, 
you know and I'm -- 
[that bothers] me a great deal. 
BRAD: [Jeez]. 
 I just [2couldn't be2]lieve that. 
PHIL: [2(H)2] 
BRAD: [3When I3] heard it. 
PHIL: [3I- 3]-- 
 I had, 
you know, 
 I came real close to calling !Ray, 
and [just sitting and] talking with him about it, 
BRAD: [Yeah]. 
PHIL: but I fi[2gured no2], 
BRAD: [2Yeah2]. 
PHIL:  I'm [3just gonna blow it off3]. 
BRAD: [3I think, 
 he's3] off the [4board, 
PHIL: [4(H) I'm gonna4] blow it off, 
BRAD:  he's4] -- 
PHIL: (H) I'm not [5gonna5] give m- -- 
BRAD: [5Yeah5]. 
PHIL: you know, 
 we've done .. everything we needed to do, 
BRAD: Right. 
PHIL: (H) 
BRAD: Right. 
PHIL: I think, 
you know, 
what !Barbara told me was that, 
 !Dolores was incredibly embarrassed, 
 by his display, 
 at this time in front of her. 
 !Dolores apolo[gized for] !Ray to him, 
BRAD: [Really]. 
Oh [2gee2]. 
PHIL: [2(H)2] So !Dolores is obviously aware that, 
BRAD: Oh gosh. 
BRAD:  you know, 
[and, 
BRAD: [(H)  Yeah, 
PHIL: she says, 
I don't know why he] resigned, 
BRAD: I don't know what's got <X in X>] -- 
PHIL: because he's been miserable, 
 (H) 
BRAD:  @ 
PHIL:  because -- 
w-  which [w=e know], 
BRAD: [Mhm], 
PHIL:  that's why he was- kept trying to get involved and make it sound, 
you know, 
like he -- 
 and n_you know, 
he was trying to make it sound like, 
(H) same old complaint, 
same old everything, 
well, 
 we didn't [have any] complaints. 
BRAD: [@] 
Yeah. 
PHIL: (H)= I think this is [2one of the2] first years, 
BRAD: [2@I @know2]. 
PHIL: (H)= that this has been so smooth. 
And I think, 
had we [realized] it, 
BRAD: [Mhm]. 
PHIL:  we [2would have allowed2] him to take a break  four years ago. 
BRAD: [2Yeah2]. 
Yeah. 
PHIL: (H) 
BRAD:  Yeah. 
PHIL:  Because, 
 and it wasn't so much- -- 
it wasn't, 
you know like I told !Jim, 
I said it wasn't anything  (H) .. that <<POUND +y=ou POUND>> did, 
 wasn't any[thing ..] else. 
BRAD: [Mhm]. 
PHIL: I said, 
it was a matter of, 
(H) you know, 
m_~Brad did, 
 % and !Pat did, 
the organization, 
 I said, 
 which was the best thing. 
I th- [I agree] with that. 
BRAD: [Mhm]. 
PHIL:  I think that was the [2best thing2] to do, 
BRAD: [2Mhm2]. 
PHIL: It was a lot of time. 
BRAD:  [Yeah]. 
PHIL: [(H)]=  But I think, 
 we need to -- 
we need to d- establish  duties. 
BRAD:  Mhm. 
PHIL: You know. 
Which we decided. 
 And see part of what we decided with these duties is, 
(H)  just deciding, 
 what we need  to do what. 
 You know. 
[There's gonna be] tasks. 
BRAD: [Mhm]. 
PHIL: (H)= 
BRAD: (H) [As specific]ally as [2we ca- -- 
PHIL: [(H) %] 
[2(Hx)2] 
BRAD: yeah2]. 
PHIL: See and I'm  I'm -- 
 (Hx) [on one hand I'd] like to take it back to where the secretary is responsible for the minutes. 
BRAD: [(THROAT)] 
Un[2hunh2]. 
PHIL: [2You know2]. 
 !Pat does [3that3], 
BRAD: [3@Yeah3], 
(H) @I @know. 
(H) There's -- 
 really the secretary serves almost no [function]. 
PHIL: [Just] i- th- [2not. 
BRAD: [2You know I, 
it's just uh2], 
PHIL:  There signs -- 
she signs] her name [2thirty times2], 
BRAD: [2Yeah2], 
PHIL: you know, 
[in the last] f- y- -- 
BRAD: [Right]. 
[2@@ @Right @~Phil. 
PHIL: [2two days ago. 
(H) Well2], 
BRAD: (H) That was2] it. 
 [3That was it3]. 
PHIL: [3(H)3] That's a [4problem4]. 
BRAD: [4That um4] -- 
PHIL: I -- 
you know, 
and I think we wanna do that. 
We need to say. 
 You know, 
!Pat's been= great enough to do this, 
%  and if she really wa=nts to do it. 
 I'm not gonna %= dissuade [her from doing] it. 
BRAD: [Yeah]. 
PHIL: (H)= But one [2thing we have to2] be careful of, 
BRAD: [2Yeah2]. 
PHIL: that I mentioned  to !Jim, 
and I've mentioned it to !Pat l=ightly. 
BRAD:  Yeah. 
PHIL: Which is  to be careful abou=t (H)= saying things. 
You know, 
like in board meetings? 
 In- interjecting too much. 
BRAD:  [Yes. 
PHIL: [Okay? 
(H)] 
BRAD: I know]. 
PHIL: Because in board discussion, 
 I mean, 
BRAD: [Yeah]. 
PHIL: [o-] on one hand, 
as a member she has every right. 
To-  to speak what she wants. 
 [Bu=t], 
BRAD: [Mhm]. 
PHIL: (H) 
BRAD:  (H) No. 
But that's[=] -- 
PHIL: [The thing] is, 
 you know. 
I've just seen  some of the looks, 
 from some of the people, 
you know, 
who feel, 
<Q I'm a board member Q>. 
BRAD: (TSK) [Yeah]. 
PHIL: [(H)] And whether -- 
the board you know, 
if they don't interject anything, 
but whether they do or not. 
 I think we have to be careful, 
BRAD:  Mhm. 
 (H) Well ~Phil, 
that, 
 [I mean that goes -- 
PHIL: [be- because, 
 where that came in], 
BRAD: That goes for] me as well then. 
It -- 
PHIL: (H) Yeah, 
it does. 
[But, 
BRAD: [It um=], 
PHIL: I think] what's different is, 
[2You2] -- 
BRAD: [2um2], 
PHIL:  you've been much more re[3sponsive in3] this sense. 
BRAD: [3I mean3], 
PHIL:  Okay? 
(H) [!Pat's more] opinionated in [2that sense. 
BRAD: [You know I] -- 
[2Unhunh. 
PHIL: Okay2]? 
BRAD: (H)2] I -- 
 what I try to do, 
is  is is just respo=nd [to question-] -- 
PHIL: [(TSK) (H) X] -- 
BRAD: and if I need to fill in blanks, 
[which], 
PHIL: [Oh yeah]. 
(H) [2That's fine2]. 
BRAD: [2You know2]. 
PHIL: That -- 
BRAD: But -- 
PHIL: See but that -- 
 your -- 
 your position .. is different. 
BRAD: M[hm. 
PHIL: [(H) Okay? 
BRAD:  That's -- 
Yeah that's true]. 
PHIL: Yours is in a] -- 
 is a much more official capacity, 
because you= are the one who answers to the board. 
BRAD: Yeah. 
PHIL: (H) 
BRAD: Right. 
PHIL: You have to do that. 
 And you are- th- ca=n voice an opinion about things. 
[(H)] 
BRAD: [Yeah]. 
PHIL: But the biggest deal, 
 where I thought it % was an issue, 
th- where I heard things about it was, 
 (H) during the annual meeting, 
right after, 
when we had the discussion about the poster. 
BRAD:  Oh[=. 
PHIL: [(H) When we brought up the] thing, 
BRAD: Was !Pat uh] -- 
PHIL: !Pat was [2right in the middle of it, 
BRAD: [2See, 
I -- 
 I wasn't there2], 
PHIL: (H) and she was2] saying, 
well this is a great piece, 
and this is this. 
(H) Well, 
BRAD:  Yeah. 
PHIL: you know, 
 [I didn't wanna em]barrass her, 
BRAD: [She shouldn't <X have done that X>]. 
PHIL: and I didn't [2wanna do anything2]. 
BRAD: [2I know2]. 
PHIL: But I just saw, 
[(H) people] kinda going, 
BRAD: [That was out] -- 
 Yeah. 
PHIL: You [know]? 
BRAD: [Yeah]. 
PHIL: And, 
[(H)] 
BRAD: [That's true]. 
She shouldn't've been [2in on that <X at all X>2]. 
BRAD: [2She shouldn't've been2], 
% you know, 
cause that's not part of her capacity, 
she's not [on that com]mittee, 
BRAD: [Mhm]. 
[2Mhm2]. 
PHIL: [2you know2], 
and if she wants -- 
(H) you know, 
 % basically the thing is, 
you know, 
if she wanted to be a boa=rd person. 
BRAD: Mhm. 
PHIL: That's fine. 
I [mean let's look] into b- pursuing that. 
BRAD: [Right]. 
Right. 
PHIL: (H)= But see I'm afraid we're gonna lose !Jim because of that. 
 he feels there's a conflict. 
And uh, 
it's definitely gonna [happen]. 
BRAD: [(H)] I mean he says. 
 There's no question about it, 
we've [talked], 
PHIL: [Yeah], 
and maybe it's right. 
 Maybe it s- [it is] gonna be right. 
BRAD: [Yeah]. 
PHIL:  You know? 
BRAD: (H)  Well he -- 
 d%= -- 
I mean he doesn't seem to -- 
 % % you've talked to him and I've [talked to him and], 
PHIL: [(H) Well], 
 he [2seems to be2] -- 
BRAD: [2I mean he says2] mayb- -- 
you know, 
after the board retreat. 
[now]. 
PHIL: [Yeah]. 
BRAD:  But not, 
PHIL: (H) Well [I a-] -- 
BRAD: [<X you know X>], 
PHIL: I wanted him, 
I said I want you to stay through the board retreat. 
BRAD:  [Yeah]. 
PHIL: [I says], 
and the reason is, 
because I said we need people who know, 
(H) I said right now we have, 
 You know, 
 f=our new board members? 
 Or [five]. 
BRAD: [Yeah]. 
PHIL:  You know, 
BRAD:  [Yeah]. 
PHIL: [Four], 
whatever. 
BRAD:  Four new board -- 
 [yeah]. 
PHIL: [(H)]  And, 
 we're at this point of saying okay. 
Uh=, 
 (H)  (Hx) ... All of a sudden, 
 (H) we have t- all these, 
 you know, 
questions [to answer]. 
BRAD: [Mhm]. 
PHIL: You know. 
we have all these things that [we have to do], 
BRAD: [Mhm]. 
PHIL: and we have (H) this commitment of time. 
 Uh=, 
 %and but they don't know, 
everything that's gone on, 
[in the last  years. 
BRAD: [They need to be educated as to -- 
PHIL: (H) See this], 
BRAD: no. 
 no]. 
PHIL: this retreat, 
that's why you see, 
I think it's important. 
 Because, 
 I mean I realized, 
 that I'd never seen the bylaws, 
 since I was [on the board] until .. [2I asked for a2] copy. 
BRAD: [Mhm]. 
[2Mhm2]. 
Right. 
 Yeah. 
 (H) Now what I -- 
 what I have done though, 
is to, 
 you know, 
 any new board member that .. jumps on, 
I send them, 
PHIL: Good. 
BRAD:  [copies of the -- 
PHIL: [(H) because, 
 I wanna] -- 
BRAD:  Yeah]. 
PHIL: I wanna [2get these  b=ooks2], 
BRAD: [2but ty- -- 
 typically they] <@ no one reads [3em @>. 
PHIL: [3(H) Well that's fine3]. 
BRAD: (H) You know3]. 
But it's -- 
[At least they've got] -- 
PHIL: [B=ut I think, 
what] I wanna do is, 
I'm gonna -- 
I wanna draft a letter. 
BRAD:  [Mhm]. 
PHIL: [Like I said] which, 
BRAD: M[2hm2]. 
PHIL: [2% says2] to them you know, 
this is what we're doing, 
this is the purpose of this retreat. 
BRAD: [Mhm]. 
PHIL: [(H)]=  To new board members, 
and, 
 you know, 
 board members, 
for a while it was, 
we need to find out  what it is we're doing. 
BRAD:  [Yeah]. 
PHIL: Whe[ther] we're doing  something right or not. 
[2You know2], 
BRAD: [2Right2]. 
PHIL: (H) 
BRAD:  [Right]. 
PHIL: [I think] we are. 
 B- [2but2], 
BRAD: [2Oh yeah2]. 
 [3Sure we are3]. 
PHIL: [3I think3], 
(H) 
BRAD: Sure [we are]. 
PHIL: [the thing] i=s, 
%=  I don't -- 
 I need to b- -- 
 them to .. kind of commit. 
 To  to being responsible. 
BRAD: Mhm. 
 Yeah. 
PHIL:  And uh, 
 (H) I mean I kinda hate to feel like I'm taking .. charge, 
but th- I guess that's what I'm  I'm needing to do. 
BRAD:  Well yeah for -- 
PHIL: [You know but, 
BRAD: [y-  y- .. you do, 
and you're-- 
PHIL: (H)  and that's .. kind of why I'm] -- 
BRAD: and you're present]. 
PHIL:  I'm going to assign things. 
BRAD: [Unhunh]. 
PHIL: [you know, 
at some] point we're gonna ha=ve committees, 
 and we're gonna have, 
(H)  you know, 
BRAD:  Mhm. 
PHIL: %b=-  people, 
 that'll be given tasks. 
BRAD: Yeah. 
PHIL: You know, 
Specifically. 
BRAD: [Yeah]. 
PHIL: [(H)] Like, 
you know, 
I didn't need to do all this calling aro-  to find a r- a r- retreat space, 
but I figured, 
 if I don't do it, 
BRAD: [That's right]. 
PHIL: [(H)] it's gonna fall on you or !pat. 
BRAD:  Yeah. 
 Of course. 
 Yeah. 
PHIL: You know. 
(H) 
BRAD: And normally that's  [that's what happens. 
PHIL: [%= That's okay 
but], 
BRAD: I mean], 
 uh=, 
PHIL: You know, 
I I'm a- I'm a- -- 
I'm aware of a lot of the things that are going on. 
 You [know, 
BRAD: [Yeah]. 
PHIL: I know that] you're getting ready to leave, 
and !Pat's  doing things so, 
(TSK) (H) [I'd better let you] go get her. 
BRAD: [Yeah]. 
 I know. 
[Okay]. 
PHIL: [And we'll contin]ue [2this2]. 
BRAD: [2Well2], 
 yeah. 
[There] -- 
PHIL: [In some] manner, 
but we don't have to talk about it at lunch if you don't want. 
But I [think, 
BRAD: [No, 
that's fine]. 
PHIL: if we can], 
 [2(H)2] 
BRAD: [2That's fine2]. 
PHIL:  If we can [3go ahead and3] carry on, 
BRAD: [3Um3], 
PHIL:  at some point, 
you and I [I think], 
BRAD: [Yeah]. 
PHIL: (H)= [2Because2] -- 
BRAD: [2One thing that2] comes to mind is, 
 is the, 
 (H) well the question of .. meeting quarterly, 
 is that .. enough. 
 Meaning having, 
(H) you know  the -- 
PHIL:  It would [be] enough [2if committees2] were to meet. 
BRAD: [%] 
[2uh2], 
If committees yeah. 
 [and]  that's the -- 
PHIL: [but] -- 
BRAD:  that -- 
 that's -- 
 that was !Paul's .. uh .. desire. 
PHIL:  (H) (TSK) [And I think], 
BRAD: [was uh] -- 
PHIL:  that's what [2we wanna2] talk ab- -- 
BRAD: [2(THROAT)2] 
PHIL: we'll talk about that there too. 
[And say] look, 
BRAD: [Mhm]. 
PHIL: you know, 
is quarterly -- 
 (H) you know, 
we- would we need to meet every other month. 
BRAD: [Mhm]. 
PHIL: [You know], 
do we need t- -- 
do we need to meet, 
you know, 
 (H) 
BRAD: as a full board every oth- -- 
(H) w%= -- 
We shouldn't have to. 
PHIL: [We shouldn't]. 
BRAD: [If the com]mittees, 
 [2uh, 
PHIL: [2(H) but these committees2] need  to be active, 
BRAD: function properly2]. 
PHIL:  and to <X do their things X>. 
[(H)] 
BRAD: [Right]. 
PHIL: Basically, 
you know, 
the publications committee, 
needs to be more involved than just making decisions on what we publish. 
[(H)] 
BRAD: [Yeah]. 
PHIL: You know, 
BRAD:  Yeah. 
PHIL:  They need to become .. somewhat self-sufficient. 
 Collections committee. 
BRAD:  [@] 
PHIL: [needs], 
 you know. 
 I would like to create .. collections committee to be something where we're almost matching? 
BRAD:  Yeah. 
PHIL:  % .. Funds they can raise maybe? 
PHIL:  Unhunh. 
 [Yeah]. 
PHIL: [You know]. 
If they can raise ten grand. 
BRAD: @Well, 
 @@[@ (H)] 
PHIL: [you know], 
BRAD: [2and have some -- 
PHIL: [2I mean realistically2] -- 
BRAD: have some2] incentive. 
PHIL: (H) Right. 
BRAD: For them to -- 
[yeah]. 
PHIL: [So that] basically they'd be, 
they'd get to a point of saying, 
BRAD:  [Mhm]. 
PHIL: [Okay we] need to be responsible <X with X> this, 
so that  collections, 
BRAD: Yeah. 
PHIL: and publications will be all  [fund raising] too. 
BRAD: [@] 
Right. 
PHIL: (H)[=] 
BRAD: [Oh boy] ~Phil, 
that's -- 
PHIL: . Yeah, 
[it's not gonna be pretty], 
BRAD: [Yeah, 
that's where] -- 
PHIL:  Because that's -- 
[(Hx)=] 
BRAD: [You know also, 
we may consider], 
you know, 
we have one board  opening. 
And I -- 
 we may think about !Gail, 
PHIL:  (H) Well !Gail is very interested, 
and so is this -- 
we met with another person by the name of !Bill !Ashby. 
BRAD:  Hm=. 
 [Yeah <X I know X>], 
PHIL: [(H)] !Jack and I and !Jim  met with him. 
BRAD:  Oh, 
you mean his, 
 !Jack's [financial] friend that -- 
PHIL: [!Jack's friend]. 
BRAD:  is retired. 
PHIL: Yeah. 
 [He's a] banker, 
BRAD: [Yeah]. 
PHIL:  and he'd be good on one hand. 
 [But], 
BRAD: [Yeah]. 
PHIL: I would like, 
(H) ideally XX I'd want em both. 
BRAD:  Yeah. 
 [Yeah]. 
BRAD: [You know]. 
 And, 
 [I'm hoping], 
BRAD: [(H) Yeah I] -- 
PHIL: what I'm gonna - 
 what I'm anticipating doing is %uh -- 
this retreat  might urge people .. (H) to say, 
I'm not interested in doing that much [work]. 
BRAD: [Yeah]. 
 And so I'm getting, 
[yeah]. 
PHIL: [(H)] And  it might just f-  get .. like !Nancy .. and !Kay, 
 [I mean I like !Kay XX], 
BRAD: [(TSK) (H) See !Nancy was] going off. 
She -- 
she @told @me she was going off this year. 
(H) And she uh, 
PHIL: (H) 
BRAD: and !Kay convinced -- 
 said well !Nancy you can't leave right away, 
and uh, 
 (H) uh=, 
 she said okay, 
I'll stay another year. 
 But, 
 I don't .. know why. 
PHIL: (H) 
BRAD: You know, 
and -- 
and then we can -- 
 %= why -- 
tha- -- 
I think that's= very important to discuss. 
 At the board .. [retreat]. 
PHIL: [(TSK) (H)] I think it is, 
because, 
I mean, 
the thing is that we need to get to a point and, 
the reason we've set terms is because, 
 basically, 
 people here, 
[(H)] 
BRAD: [Mhm]. 
PHIL: majority of us have been here a long time. 
BRAD: (TSK) Yeah. 
 That's right. 
PHIL:  You know, 
 and, 
 [there's a point] -- 
BRAD: [well that's why we] have this, 
the term limitation. 
PHIL:  Unhunh. 
BRAD: [XXX (H)] 
PHIL: [I'm -- 
 I -- 
I'm] uh full agreement, 
cause I'm ready. 
 [You know]? 
BRAD: [Yeah]. 
PHIL: (H) [2I've a2]greed to do this term, 
BRAD: [2Yeah2]. 
 Mhm. 
PHIL:  but, 
BRAD:  [Mhm]. 
PHIL: [my feeling] is, 
I'm ready, 
 for  a year off. 
BRAD: Yeah. 
PHIL: (H) [You know]. 
BRAD: [Mhm]. 
PHIL: a=nd I'll still be volunteering, 
 but, 
I really am ready fo=r, 
some time to say. 
BRAD: Mhm. 
PHIL: (H) You know, 
and I wanted !Jim to consider being market manager, 
even if he goes off the board. 
BRAD:  Yeah. 
 (H) I know, 
he was wavering a little @bit @on that, 
 whether or not he would volunteer, 
 at the marketing center. 
PHIL:  (H) Yeah. 
[I mean there's %= -- 
BRAD: [I've gotta run now]. 
PHIL: O]kay. 
j- -- 
[See you ~Brad]. 
BRAD: [Um], 
 but, 
 the lun- -- 
 [uh=], 
PHIL: [(H) We're gonna] meet here. 
BRAD:  Oh you're gonna [2have x2] -- 
PHIL: [2so we can d-2] either swing by for you, 
or we can decide, 
we'll call you. 
BRAD:  Oh -- 
 [so <X you're not X>] -- 
PHIL: [when I know what we're] doing, 
if you want, 
BRAD:  Okay, 
that'd be great. 
 [Alright],

MONTOYA: What else. 
 Politics deals with the question of power. 
right? 
 That's the introduction to empowerment. 
 What is power. 
 Very quickly, 
come on, 
 all of you should know these two concepts, 
 they're not that difficult, 
 What is power. 
What are we talking about. 
FRANK:  Having the capacity to impact public policy. 
MONTOYA: Alright. 
(H) So if we're talking about politics, 
politics is tied into the whole concept of power. 
right? 
 And if we're talking about  empowerment as a concept, 
(H) we must have an understanding of the notion of what is power. 
(H) Now does  power come in one form, 
does it come in many different forms. 
MARIA:  Different. 
MONTOYA:  Different forms. 
 Back here. 
 What forms. 
 Give me examples of power. 
 Either one of you. 
RUBEN:  @@[@] 
LAURA: [@] 
RUBEN:  (H) Education, 
 know[ledge, 
MONTOYA: [Alright, 
 knowledge], 
RUBEN: knowledge]. 
MONTOYA  Okay, 
 what else. 
LAURA:  U=m, 
X: <WH Money WH>. 
LAURA:  u=m, 
 your  position in the workforce? 
 U=m, 
MONTOYA: Okay, 
LAURA: <X I'm trying to think of the word X>. 
MONTOYA: Alright. 
 Close. 
Right. 
RAMON: Wealth, 
 num[bers], 
MONTOYA: [Wealth]. 
RAMON: numbers of people, 
MONTOYA: Numbers of people. 
 right? 
 What else. 
FRANK:  Social status. 
MONTOYA:  Social status, 
 position, 
 right? 
(H) If you're the chairperson of u=m  a major corporation? 
 would you say that that person  has some power? 
FRANK:  Most definitely. 
MONTOYA:  Alright. 
 Especially if you're <X in uh X> IBM, 
or General Motors, 
or  Chrysler [Corporation and], 
RAMON: [I think in some] __ 
 some t_ __ 
 some examples, 
some, 
 gender and race=, 
 can give you power. 
MONTOYA:  Gender race, 
alright. 
RAMON: [Gender] __ 
MONTOYA: [Let's deal] with that. 
 Alright. 
 Gender race. 
 Let's talk about (H) race, 
 in terms of power. 
 I=f I make the statement which I di=d, 
 that there's no fear factor, 
when it comes to=  the Chicano_Latino community, 
(H) and there is much more of a fear factor, 
 in dealing with the African_American community, 
 (H) am I not dealing with a racial factor of power? 
RAMON:  [<WH Yes= WH>]. 
FRANK: [Sure]. 
MONTOYA: Why. 
FRANK:  Because it's gonna affect, 
 the decision making process, 
 the politics, 
<X and um, 
 [the policy X>]. 
MONTOYA: [Alright]. 
RAMON:  Africa_ __ 
I=n u=m, 
 i_ __ 
 Kinda like in pas=t, 
 African_Americans have been more organized, 
and have  had more leaders, 
(H)  or not more leaders, 
but who have more leaders who've been kn=own, 
or [something, 
MONTOYA: [More recognized. 
RAMON: like Martin Luther King_, 
MONTOYA:  That's right]. 
RAMON: Yeah, 
more rec]ognized, 
and, 
MONTOYA:  [Alright]. 
RAMON: [I think] that's a fear factor. 
[2XX2] 
MONTOYA: [2That is2] a part of the fear factor. 
RAMON:  [3Mhm3]. 
MONTOYA: [3(H)3] I mean uh, 
if  one looks at what, 
uh, 
Jesse Jackson is doing, 
vis a vis (H)  who. 
 The major league? 
 Baseball teams and all that? 
 Football= and all that? 
 (H) What's his underlying argument. 
 What's his criticism. 
 That there're not . sufficient numbers of= .. what? 
FRANK:  Blacks. 
MONTOYA:  Well he says minorities. 
 He's smart. 
He's talks about minorities. 
But he's really talking about African_Americans. 
FRANK:  In the uh, 
 managerial process [of], 
MONTOYA: [Right]. 
FRANK:  of .. professional sports. 
MONTOYA: Exactly. 
 Managerial, 
 owners, 
 managers, 
et cetera. 
right? 
 Alright. 
(Hx) Have you heard <X of a Latino X> say this? 
 Or would a XXX Jesse Jackson have said that about Latinos? 
 Hm? 
 No. 
 <X Unh_unh X>. 
We haven't. 
 And uh we're gonna get into that, 
 in our discussion. 
 Alright. 
(H) So, 
 the whole notion of power is very important  to understand, 
because, 
here I am making some statements. 
Alright? 
 Some generalities that some people would say are not true=. 
I mean how can (H) Doctor ~Montoya say that Latinos have no=, 
no real power, 
no fear factor, 
After all, 
(H) they have two people that are cabinet members, 
 they have (H) supervisor here in Los Angeles, 
they have city council people in Los Angeles, 
and yet he's saying that they have no power. 
 (H) Well power is relative  as well. 
right? 
 It's relative. 
It's relational. 
 Power is relational. 
 How can you measure power. 
 Power is impossible to measure. 
 Alright? 
 In other words, 
you cannot break power apart into vi_ __ 
(H) various ingredients, 
 and say, 
 A, 
 B, 
 C, 
 D, 
these are the ingredients of power. 
(H)  We can make generalities. 
 Position. 
 Wealth. 
 All these different things that I've talked about. 
(H) But power is difficult to measure. 
 So that, 
 we must deal with the whole question of empowerment, 
 from also the perspective of potential power (H) versus actual power. 
 There is a difference. 
 If I am, 
 for example, 
 the president (H)  of .. a major labor union, 
 or a major corporation. 
 the position, 
 (H) as president of that entity, 
 gives me so much power. 
 But yet if I do not know how to utili=ze, 
 that entity in terms of its mobilization, 
(H)  for a given objective, 
 like a labor union. 
 If I have fourteen million people as members, 
(H) and I don't show any manifestation of power, 
am I powerful. 
 Well, 
 it has to be measured by what  you're trying to do. 
what the objectives are. 
 Example. 
 L=abor today, 
is being challenged by perhaps one of the most  serious . pieces ... of __ 
 not legislation per se, 
because it's not in a legislative form yet, 
(H) but, 
 a proposed North American Free Trade Agreement, 
 that if passed by Congress, 
 is going to impact  three economies. 
 Canada, 
 U.S., 
 and Mexico. 
 (H) L=abor, 
as a sector, 
 is going to be the most  impacted. 
 How is labor today . mobilizing .. its great power. 
 Uh not just the AFL_CIO and its fourteen million members, 
(H) but the United Auto Workers, 
 and many other or_ .. labor organizations, 
 what are they doing. 
 to influence .. public .. policy. 
FRANK:  Combining power. 
MONTOYA:  Huh? 
FRANK:  They're combining their power. 
MONTOYA:  How are they combining their power. 
FRANK:  By al_ allying with other, 
 um, 
 (TSK) unions [<X of workers X>]. 
MONTOYA: [Alright, 
they're they're they're] forming coalitions, 
 among themselves, 
they're forming coalitions with who. 
Environmental groups. 
right? 
 Cause  environment supposedly is going to be also negatively impacted. 
 especially along the border. 
 Alright, 
 so there's_, 
 there's a lot of coalition building. 
 But can you say as a historian, 
 that labor is doing what they were infamous for doing thirty forty years ago? 
 Taking [to the] streets? 
FRANK: [No]. 
No they've definitely lost power. 
MONTOYA:  Alright, 
 good point. 
 They have __ 
 He said, 
 they have lost power. 
(H) So your measurement  of a loss of power is based on what. 
FRANK:  What they can and can't X[XX]. 
MONTOYA: [Alright]. 
 Alright. 
 You don't see, 
 what you've read about=. 
 right? 
FRANK:  Right. 
MONTOYA:  today. 
 Alright. 
 That's one perception. 
 Is the Black community less powerful today, 
 in nineteen_ninety_three, 
than it wa=s, 
(H)  in nineteen . sixty ... eight. 
 with the poor people's march on Washington, 
(H)  or nineteen_sixty_three, 
 again, 
 on the w_ uh= march .. uh to Washington, 
 on Washington, 
 when Martin Luther King gave his (H)  famous speech, 
I have a dream. 
 There were three hundred thousand people. 
 at that march in nineteen_sixty_three. 
 Which . period .. of time, 
historically speaking, 
(H)  was a time where Blacks were manifesting much more power. 
 Today, 
 or nineteen_sixty_three, 
or nineteen_sixty_eight. 
 When. 
RACHEL: <X When they m_ X> manifest, 
they're beginning to get more power? 
MONTOYA:  % When uh, 
in in comp_ __ 
[in in __ 
RACHEL: [Now]? 
MONTOYA: When] do uh, 
<X make X> a comparison nineteen_ninety_three, 
(H) nineteen_sixty_eight, 
 nineteen_sixty_three, 
 during those three periods, 
 when, 
 would you say, 
 Blacks .. demonstrated .. much more power. 
RACHEL:  Now? 
 They have more power now. 
MONTOYA:  They have more power? 
 Why do you say that. 
RACHEL:  Cause they're more recognized. 
 <X I mean X>, 
MONTOYA:  (H) Does recognition give you power? 
 Hm? 
X:  <P Yeah P>. 
FRANK:  To a_ __ 
 To some  aspects, 
yeah. 
 I think, 
 I think the __ 
the problem with your question is, 
s_ a different sort of powers. 
MONTOYA:  Ah=. 
Very good. 
 Explain that. 
FRANK:  You have uh, 
 you have African_Americans more institutionalized, 
 in [our] system now, 
MONTOYA: [<X Ah X>]. 
FRANK:  than they were in six[2ty_eight2]. 
MONTOYA: [2Alright2]. 
Stop right there. 
 Today, 
 they have how many Congressmen? 
 Thirty  eight. 
 Thirty . eight ... congressional representatives. 
 I don't know how many they had in nineteen_sixty_three, 
I'm not even gonna try to guess, 
but uh probably (H) no more than two or three if they were lucky. 
 Alright. 
 Would you say that? 
FRANK:  <X I would say that's right X>. 
MONTOYA: Alright. 
 Go on. 
 What else. 
FRANK:  I=n sixty_eight, 
 the Blacks were a whole lot more  mobile. 
 mobilized. 
 Much better mobilized, 
 three_hundred_thousand marching on Washington, 
 is an example. 
 You probably couldn't get that today. 
MONTOYA: Okay. 
 Alright. 
RAMON:  (COUGH) 
MONTOYA: <X You know with X>Chicanos, 
the highpoint of the mobilization capability was nineteen_seventy. 
 During the= era of the Vietnam W=ar. 
 Twenty_five_thousand Chicanos were mobilized in Los Angeles, 
 %a_ %at the national Chicano moratorium  against the war. 
 No one. 
 has come even close. 
 With the exception of the death of Cesar Chavez recently, 
(H) where there were approximately forty_thousand people, 
 to mobilize. 
 large numbers  of people, 
into some kind of a  effort or movement. 
 Alright. 
 (H) So he's correct. 
 It depends  on the time, 
 depends on the circumstances, 
(H) and the form of power. 
(H) Institutionalized power is different from, 
 the unconventional form that uh y_ you just described. 
Alright. 
 (H) Well what we're trying to get at, 
 is potential .. versus .. actual. 
 My argument, 
 as humble as it is, 
 is that  Chicanos, 
 in nineteen_ninety_three, 
 are fast developing, 
 a high=  potential for power, 
 but they're a long way= from actualizing  their true power. 
 Okay? 
In other words, 
they're_ we're still at the=  potential phase of our empowerment, 
 and not at the actual power phase. 
 Alright. 
 Anything else? 
 On= those two concepts? 
 Alright. 
 Let's get into=  discussion on voter participation, 
and these are kind of general comments, 
 I don't have the time to give you a lot of statistics, 
 but I'll give you some=, 
 general uh=  trends, 
 some statistical information, 
(H) that will prove a point, 
(H) that will introduce the subject  of  political participation, 
(H) in the United States. 
 Now, 
a democracy, 
 the participation of the citizenry is imperative. 
 It is . absolutely imperative, 
 if it's to be a democracy, 
to have the people participate. 
(H) Now what am I trying to say. 
 What am I trying to say. 
 It is  imperative for the people to participate, 
 in the political process. 
 Another way of saying it. 
 What am I saying. 
CAROLYN:  We have to vote, 
 <X everyone X>, 
MONTOYA:  But why is it important, 
 in a democracy for the people to participate. 
 Just deal with the question. 
 Not the methods, 
CAROLYN:  <X You mean X> becaus=e .. if=  the people don't v=ote, 
 it will be=, 
 there will be an elite group, 
it'll be  m=ore of a .. m=onarchy, 
 that has control, 
 [it won't be] a democracy. 
MONTOYA: [Okay], 
what's a monarchy. 
RUBEN:  [Kings], 
FRANK: [One ruler], 
CAROLYN:  Well [2one2] __ 
RUBEN: [2Royalty2]. 
MONTOYA:  What? 
FRANK: [One ruler], 
RUBEN: [Royalty], 
 [2or one family2]. 
CAROLYN: [2XXXX2] 
MONTOYA:  Alright. 
 Close. 
 There's a royal  type of family right, 
 [king], 
CAROLYN: [Yeah]. 
MONTOYA:  not elected, 
 alright, 
 hereditary, 
et cetera et cetera, 
 alright. 
 But what am I getting at. 
 %W_ what's the= essence of what I'm asking for? 
 Yes. 
 Fire away. 
RUBEN:  By= . its very nature, 
 democracy demands  voting. 
Without vo[ting XX] __ 
MONTOYA: [Ah]. 
 Stop right there. 
 You made a statement. 
By the very nature of democracy. 
 (H) What is a democracy. 
RUBEN:  Democracy is rule by the people. 
MONTOYA:  Alright. 
 (H) <L2 Demos  cratos L2>. 
right? 
 [People] . rule. 
RUBEN: [XX]? 
MONTOYA: Another Greek word. 
 The Greeks were .. major contributors to this political process of development, 
 of concepts. 
<L2 Demos  cratos L2>. 
People  govern, 
or people rule. 
 Alright. 
 We tell the world, 
 that democracy . is what .. we practice. 
Is that correct? 
 Is that what we tell the world? 
MANY:  Yeah. 
MONTOYA: Yes? 
 Alright. 
Would you agree <X with that X>? 
 Okay. 
 What else do we say, 
selling  our political system. 
 (H) In selling our political system, 
 we make it synonymous, 
 synonymous  by saying= that, 
 we don't distinguish, 
 the form of economic system, 
 versus the political system, 
(H) and that we put it in the same kettle. 
 (H) Democracy, 
 and capitalism, 
 are essentially the same. 
 Are they the same. 
FRANK:  No. 
MONTOYA:  No. 
 But yet we do. 
 (H) A=nd, 
 if we= .. listen carefully, 
 and read carefully, 
 a=ll these books on international relations, 
 foreign relations and so forth, 
 what is it that we tell the world, 
 that America is. 
 The cradle  of democracy. 
 We are the cradle of democracy, 
(H) we are the bastion of the free world, 
 et cetera et cetera et cetera. 
 And when (H) Ronald Reagan was in power, 
 we talked about the evil empire. 
right? 
 (H) Categorizing, 
 uh=, 
the Soviet Union, 
 and the so_called Communist empire, 
as a evil empire. 
 Alright. 
 I say this because, 
(H)  there is, 
 a tendency for some of us to= believe, 
because, 
 we have been conditioned. 
right? 
 Who conditions us to think the way we think. 
 What did we deci_ __ 
 What did we say. 
 earlier. 
 talking about culture. 
RACHEL:  Um, 
 they learn through .. schools, 
 [<X through their families X>]. 
MONTOYA: [Schools. 
right]? 
 Schools. 
 The media. 
 Everything else. 
 (H) .. I mean, 
 doesn't the media tell us that there's only a two_party system in this country? 
FRANK:  Mhm. 
FRANK:  Mhm. 
Why is it 
 that the Communist Party, 
the Socialist Workers Party, 
the Prohibitionist Party, 
the American Independent Party, 
(H)  all these parties that we have, 
 supposedly minority parties, 
 don't get the same kind of treatment, 
 as the Democratic and Republican parties. 
 They're not mainstream. 
right? 
 We have a two-party system. 
(H) We are taught from the very beginning that there's only two parties. 
 That's a l- different subject. 
 But I'm -- 
 What I'm -- 
The point I'm trying to make is that, 
 if we look  into the realities, 
 of what we have as a political system, 
 we tell the world, 
that in this country democracy is very much alive, 
because we ha=ve, 
a congress, 
we have, 
(H) a supreme court, 
 we have a presidency, 
(H) we have a political system=, 
that i=s, 
 governed by certain principles, 
 and law=s, 
(H) that emanate from what. 
 The Constitution. 
 which is a living document. 
The Constitution. 
right? 
(H) That is very much the document that protects, 
(H) conceptually and otherwise, 
 our way of life. 
 Our democracy and so forth. 
 Well, 
 if we remember  our Chicano history, 
 my point, 
as we get into the whole question of Chicano political participation, 
%is that, 
(H)  it's difficult, 
 for us as Chicanos, 
 as we get into it, 
 to understand, 
 why is it, 
 including ourselves, 
 because a lot of Chicanos don't even understand why we don't vote, 
 why don't we participate, 
 and they come up with all kinds of (H) somewhat superficial analysis, 
 that, 
 m=uch of our political behavior, 
 is a product of what . was covered in this class, 
 under history, 
(H) and culture, 
and what did I say. 
 Two. 
 major currents, 
 of history, 
 two  major currents of political culture, 
 right? 
And what is political culture. 
 I'll get back to that concept. 
But just  general terms. 
 What is political culture. 
 What is political culture. 
 Alright. 
 I want you to think -- 
Put that concept down, 
 because you're gonna -- 
you're gonna hear about it in the next few minutes. 
 It's very important that you understand that concept. 
Political culture. 
(H) But I want -- 
 Thing I want to underline here, 
 is that, 
 we are products, 
(H) of a historical, 
 dualistic process, 
 Mexico's history, 
US history, 
(H) we're a pr- -- 
we're products of what? 
 A cultural process, 
that's also Mexican, 
 and American. 
 Whatever American means. 
Alright? 
 So those two major  ingredients, 
(H) have molded, 
the rationale, 
 that I'm using in this class, 
 to explain, 
 why is it, 
 that we're still, 
 at the potential phase of empowerment, 
 and we still, 
 have a long ways to go, 
 before we realize, 
 that concept that I describe, 
 called empowerment. 
 (H) But before we get into that s-  substance of that, 
(H) is that, 
 I wanna just briefly cover, 
 that, 
 even though, 
 I'm saying that, 
 Chicanos do not vote in great numbers. 
 And we don't participate in many organizations in great numbers. 
(H) The fact is, 
 as I mentioned earlier, 
 that even though we tell the world, 
 we are this beacon of light, 
 of freedom, 
 of liberty, 
 justice, 
and all these different things, 
(H) by and large, 
 not . a lot of people .. participate .. politically .. across the board. 
 I don't care if you're African-American, 
 I don't care if you're Asian-American, 
 and I don't care if you're Latino, 
or whatever. 
 Most Americans, 
 do not vote, 
 in great numbers. 
 So, 
 it's a double whammy. 
 Introducing the subject matter here. 
 Americans, 
in comparison to Great Britain, 
 in comparison to France, 
(H) in comparison to Germany, 
 in comparison to Italy, 
 we don't vote, 
 in the numbers that they do. 
 Alright? 
 I mean, 
if we had more time, 
I could give you statistic after statistic, 
(H) Italy for example, 
ha=s  a voter  turnout, 
 of ninety percent. 
 Of those that are eligible to vote. 
 we're lucky if we get fifty percent. 
 Are we  less democratic? 
 Are they more democratic? 
 Why is it that Italy has, 
(H) a much larger, 
 a higher voter .. level of participation. 
 Or Germany. 
 Or even Canada. 
 Seventy percent. 
 The fact is, 
that democracy in this country  is dying. 
 I want you to put that down. 
 Cause it's gonna be important. 
 At least for my analysis. 
I don't want you to agree, 
or disagree at this point, 
just write it down, 
 (H) you have plenty of time. 
 One week to think about it. 
 American democracy is dying. 
 I want you to put that . who=le .. phrase .. in black and white. 
(H) American democracy is dying, 
 and I want you to try to think  of why. 
 As we get into the discussion .. of Chicano  participation. 
 And we'll get back to that statement  next week. 
 So, 
 for us, 
as Chicanos it's a double jeopardy. 
 That's another point I wanna underscore. 
 Because if the  larger general population doesn't vote in great numbers, 
(H) when you're at the bottom of a political socioeconomic totem pole, 
and you're at the bottom, 
 you're at the very bottom, 
 with all the problems of poverty, 
and all the social problems that we're -- 
(H) we've been talking about, 
 it's understandable why, 
 perhaps, 
 Chicanos do not vote, 
 or participate in great numbers. 
 (H) Now, 
 the literature, 
 in political science, 
 dealing with, 
 factors influence- -- 
 influencing voting, 
 are many. 
 Are many. 
 Civic Culture, 
 Almond and Verba, 
 nineteen-seventy-two or so, 
 is one book that you can look at, 
 u=m, 
 there's a book by  Raymond Wolfinger, 
 Steven . Ronsteen- .. Ronstone I'm sorry, 
(H) Who Votes, 
 that's another book, 
 <X Okay X>, 
 the literature goes on and on. 
 But all I want to do, 
in terms of just giving you  some idea. 
 of what are the factors that influence, 
peoples' participation in the political process of this country. 
(H) And there are essentially five. 
 You can .. probably develop more, 
but, 
 these are general categories. 
 Most of the literature in political science, 
 and I think Mister Verba would agree with me on this, 
(H) that, 
 people tend to vote because they have a sense of duty. 
 What does that mean. 
 A sense of duty. 
 They regard participation as important. 
 Now, 
 why would you say, 
 that this .. is a factor that influences voting. 
 Now this is a very somewhat altruistic, 
 uh= value. 
right? 
 A sense of  duty? 
 Why. 
 Why would you say, 
 that people in this country have a -- 
 Some [people that vote], 
X: [(COUGH) (COUGH)] 
MONTOYA:  vote because they have a s=ense .. of .. duty. 
 Why. 
 Right here. 
BEV:  I don't know, 
 probably it stems m=ostly from=, 
 your education, 
your childhood, 
when your told, 
%  you're an American citizen, 
and it's your civic duty, 
 you know, 
(H) towards other people a=nd, 
you know, 
getting the government going, 
 to vote, 
a=nd, 
put you=r two cents in. 
 Because without you=, 
 then y- we won't have government. 
 Same sense of jury duty, 
too. 
 [<X Jury] -- 
MONTOYA: [Okay]. 
 Good point. 
BEV: duty X>. 
MONTOYA:  As we go through some of these, 
 these five, 
 I want you to think of %the agents of socialization. 
 Because then I want you to think, 
when we get into the discussion on Chicanos, 
 how do those agents affect  us as Chicanos. 
Alright, 
 number one, 
sense of duty, 
 Who is responsible for inculcating . that sense of duty. 
 One, 
 the family. 
 Alright? 
 Remember. 
 The family is your primary agent. 
 Two, 
 the educational institutions. 
 I mean, 
from the time that you start  kindergarten, 
to the time that you  graduate from the university, 
(H) it's constant, 
 not constant, 
 but somewhat of a consistent .. bombardment .. of values, 
 attitudes, 
et cetera, 
 reinforcing the nature of the political system, 
 and the virtues  of ... participating in the political process. 
 (H) So in essence, 
what I'm saying is, 
you acquire this through the socialization process. 
that we've discussed already. 
 Yes? 
RUBEN:  I think that it's more . eye-opening, 
 to see, 
 that, 
 this doesn't exist, 
 more than it does. 
 And that's why people don't vote. 
(H) It seems that, 
 I mean you talk to people, 
(H) they have an attitude, 
 I can't make a difference. 
 That's why I don't vote. 
 It's not  my .. responsibility. 
That's why I don't vote. 
 There's not a sense of duty. 
 Even though, 
 like you said, 
 from the beginning, 
 supposedly we're getting it  all through school. 
MONTOYA: Why do you suppose that has changed. 
 And this is a  much, 
 of a recent phenomena. 
 much more. 
(H) Because you've had, 
(H)  declining voter participation levels=, 
since= the nineteen-seventies. 
 And I'm giving you the answer. 
 Wa- what what what has been the problem. 
 Contributing to what you  just said. 
RAMON:  Well, 
I agree- -- 
I agree with what he was saying but, 
 I think m- maybe one of the reasons could be, 
 they're not being represented, 
they don't think they're being represented,

FRED:  Okay. 
One= large loan (Hx), 
 renewed (Hx), 
 a hundred ninety-seven=  thousand, 
a hundred eighty dollars. 
 It's on ~Gerald and ~Pamela. 
JIM:  O[kay]. 
FRED: [They've pai]d, 
they've reduced, 
 no problem. 
 He's handled his line of credit as agreed, 
so it's  pretty routine. 
 ~Joe? 
JOE:  <P Okay P>. 
 (TSK) (H) First . loan request I have, 
is= an existing real estate mortgage, 
that (H)  will be  refinanced into the secondary market of Fannie Mae. 
 (H) Customer is ~Gerry and ~Pamela Tucker, 
(H)  at sixty-one fifty-eight ~Main Street, 
in ~Hillsdale Illinois, 
(H) they're requesting eighty-four thousand dollars, 
on a thirty-year Fannie Mae fixed rate loan, 
 (H) this would include the cost of doing the refinance appraisal, 
 title work, 
 and points. 
FRED:  [Eighty-four]? 
JOE: [(H)]  Eighty four even. 
 (THROAT) 
 Their monthly payment of principle interest taxes and insurance, 
(H) would be seven sixty-one eighty-nine, 
 based at the current thirty-year rate. 
 (H) .. They estimate the value of their home to be (Hx), 
one-hundred (Hx) and ten  thousand dollars. 
 (H) .. We had an appraisal in nineteen ninety-one, 
by a certified appraiser, 
 that indicates the value of the house was a hundred and three thousand dollars. 
(H) Eighty percent of that would make it  eighty-two four. 
So, 
(H)  u=m, 
 in order to make them a loan for eighty-four thousand, 
it m=ust appraise for a hundred and five. 
So that will be, 
(THROAT) 
(H) will determine whether or not we can go the full eighty-four, 
 and whether they have to come up with some money out of pocket. 
 Their assets total one sixteen four seventeen, 
(H)  their= liabilities (Hx) eighty .. -three, 
 (H) .. their= .. net worth .. thirty-one. 
FRED:  [So all they] owe is the house? 
JOE: [(H)] 
Mhm. 
 (H) They um, 
 [(TSK)] 
FRED: [T T] T. 
JOE: currently have a debt to income of twenty-eight over twenty-seven, 
 (H) and after the refinance, 
they would have a  debt to income of fifteen over twenty-three. 
 [(TSK) (H)] 
JIM: [Where are they] now, 
 I missed that. 
 They're fifteen over -- 
JOE:  No. 
 They're currently .. twenty & 
FRED:  They can't [be]. 
JOE: & [ove]r twenty-seven.

JOE: (H) It's twenty3] over twenty-seven, 
FRED: [4(H) Okay4]. 
JOE: [4(H) And after4] the refi it's fifteen over twenty-three. 
KURT:  What is acceptable pretty much, 
uh, 
[ what figures]. 
JOE: [(TSK) (H) Twenty-eight over] thirty-six is the maxe[2s2]. 
KURT: [2I2]t's [3as high as it could go? 
JOE: [3See, 
 so they're well within, 
KURT:  Okay. 
 I just wondered. 
JOE:  They're well within their .. debt to income3]. 
KURT: I (H)= always heard the3] figures, 
and never did know what was high, 
and, 
JOE: Right. 
KURT: low don't make any difference. 
JOE: Yeah. 
(H) [Um], 
FRED: [So you said they're] gonna be  fifteen? 
JOE:  Mhm. 
 Fifteen over twenty-three so, 
(H) their debt to income (THROAT) isn't a problem, 
 the, 
(H) uh=, 
 problem as I see it is, 
 the value of the house, 
number one, 
 (H) and the second (Hx) matter at hand is, 
that, 
 in nineteen eighty-seven, 
 (H) they had filed a chapter eleven. 
(H) They had at the time a mortgage with us, 
(H) They reaffirmed on that mortgage, 
 They were never late, 
(H)  We= (Hx), 
uh, 
 After that  discharge, 
we even advanced them (H) money to purchase this house, 
on ~Main st- (H) Street here in ~Hillsdale, 
and um, 
 (TSK) they have never missed a payment on that loan, 
(H)  I've also made them car loans, 
that they've never missed a payment on (Hx), 
a=nd um, 
(TSK) according to Fannie Mae guidelines, 
as long as they have (H) been discharged, 
 at least two years, 
(H) and  reestablished and paid as agreed, 
(H) their credit obligations, 
they would qualify for a Fannie Mae mortgage. 
 (H) With that in mind (Hx), 
 u=m, 
 (H) I am moving, 
that they app- -- 
 uh, 
that we approve this loan request, 
subject to (H) a uh=  certified appraisal of their home. 
FRED:  Do we have the discharge? 
JOE:  Yes=. 
 [I have] a copy of it. 
FRED: [Mhm]. 
When was it. 
JOE:  It was discharged on=, 
 November, 
 uh no. 
 Two twenty-three eighty-eight. 
 Discharge date was two twenty-three of eighty-eight. 
FRED:  When did they file. 
Didn't you say they filed in [eighty-seven]? 
JOE: [Eleven of eighty]-seven. 
FRED:  In eleven? 
JOE:  Mhm. 
JIM:  Three months? 
Whew. 
 That's pretty fast. 
JOE: [Yeah. 
FRED: [What did they do. 
JOE: (H)] 
FRED: Dis]miss it? 
JOE: It was a business -- 
 No, 
it was a business, 
uh, 
bankruptcy, 
and, 
(H) it was pretty cut and dried, 
they jus=t were eliminating the business=, 
um, 
 debt, 
(H) and apparently nobody objected to the, 
 the bankruptcy. 
 Since they reaffirmed with their secured creditors. 
(H) All the debt that was=  charged- -- 
that was bank-  filed bankruptcy against was (H) unsecured creditors. 
FRED:  And they discharged em, 
before they even performed, 
or anything? 
JOE:  (TSK) Yeah, 
in a three mon- -- 
I guess so, 
in a p- three-month period of time, 
cause here's the, 
FRED:  No I -- 
 I just, 
 it's unusual that they don't require em to -- 
you know, 
usually they put em on a two-year or three-year plan or some[thing], 
JOE: [M]hm, 
 (H) See, 
the- from what I % I gathered is the, 
 unsecured creditors got nothing, 
 (H) and the secured creditors, 
 just carried on their payment history as agreed. 
 As originally set forth in their contracts. 
FRED:  <X But you know X> usually the plan'll [provide some period] of time of protection. 
JOE: [Oh I -- 
Yeah]. 
 Mhm. 
FRED: But if we've [got uh] -- 
JOE: [for those unse]cured creditors. 
FRED:  Yeah. 
 But if we've got the .. discharge, 
JIM:  Yeah. 
FRED: Okay. 
 Well, 
[in that case], 
JIM: [That's hard to] believe, 
because it says that, 
 notice of joint -- 
 discharge of joint debtors, 
it -- 
 it appears the persons named above, 
filed a petition, 
commencing & 
FRED:  Yeah? 
JIM: &  [joint]  case under title eleven, 
JOE: [mhm]. 
JIM:  on November twenty-third, 
of nineteen eighty-seven? 
 A=nd that an order of relief has been entered, 
 no complaint objecting to the discharge of the debtors was filed, 
within the time fixed by the court @,

JOE: [Mhm]. 
FRED: [2you know, 
JIM: [2Yeah. 
 What2] -- 
FRED: the five2] -- 
JIM:  What actually happened to them, 
 (H) was, 
 she opened . a franchise. 
 A=nd it was, 
 a franchise of doing packaging, 
sending m-, 
uh, 
from a mall  basis, 
FRED: [Unhunh]? 
JIM: [(H)] uh=, 
packaging, 
 gift wrapping, 
 and ship[ping]. 
KURT: [shipping] it. 
JOE: (COUGH) [2(COUGH)2] 
JIM: [2Well2], 
what hap[3pened3], 
JOE: [3(COUGH)3] 
JIM:  They should have gotten into the business, 
hindsight's twenty twenty, 
They should've gotten into the business in let's say August, 
(H) a=nd then they would've had a Christmas season. 
There was a t- -- 
 It got to be real complicated, 
(H) and they didn't get in until February. 
 Well February they had nothing to do and, 
 and I [think they], 
FRED: [Yeah]. 
JIM: They hung in there for (H)  a year .. and a half. 
 And they just couldn't -- 
 couldn't see end to it. 
FRED: [XX] -- 
KURT: [February] nobody's shipping anything. 
 @@[2@@ 
FRED: [2I'll s- -- 
 I'll second2] then ~Joe. 
KURT: (H)2] 
JOE: Okay. 
JIM:  So it's moved and seconded  to uh, 
JOE:  (TSK) (H) approve that loan subject to the, 
 uh, 
 appraisal by a certified appraisal. 
FRED:  And the max is eighty-four? 
JOE:  Mhm. 
FRED:  Okay. 
JIM:  Okay. 
 (TSK) All in favor aye. 
FRED:  [Aye]. 
KURT: [Aye]. 
JOE: Aye. 
JIM:  Opposed same sign. 
 Motion carries. 
FRED:  (SIGH) 
 Is that the only one (Hx)? 
JOE:  (TSK) (H) That's the= only loan I have. 
FRED: Okay. 
 I got one small one. 
 The only reason it's in here=, 
 is because the borrowers already ha=ve, 
 three-hundred three thousand borrowed, 
so it has to be approved by the board, 
(H)  but if we, 
if ~Jim and  ~Kurt approve it today, 
that'd be two, 
and then I'll have to call two more. 
 Uh=, 
 they wanna borrow f=orty f- -- 
Well, 
 ~Dave wants to borrow forty-five hundred dollars to=, 
 finish paying off  the renovation, 
 and upgrade necessary o=n the  daycare. 
 A=nd, 
 he had . initially thought what he borrowed would do it, 
and then he borrowed some money from his uncle, 
and he wants to repay his uncle and get that out of the way. 
(H) He wants to set it up on a year, 
 uh=, 
it would be secured via three vehicles, 
 u=m, 
 you know his debt to income is relatively high, 
but his income's going up, 
 the daycare is scheduled to open  a week after= the fifth. 
 So= around the twelfth to fifteenth of January, 
 <@he thought he's been @> -- 
(H) he thought he was already opened, 
and then they came back in and told him he couldn't open. 
 Cause there was articles in the paper, 
and they showed kids at the daycare and, 
 he had his ads out and everything, 
(H) but he didn't have all the i's dotted and t's crossed, 
and state came back in and said, 
we=ll, 
no, 
you can't really do that. 
 So=, 
(H) one group of state people, 
the people that do all the -- 
 do the testing for=, 
 electrical and safety and stuff have been there, 
and now the state (H) inspector's got to come in, 
I guess they just  look at .. the quality of the facility. 
 Not necessarily the wiring plumbing and heating, 
but, 
(H) is it clean, 
and is it safe, 
and that sort of thing. 
 (H) They're supposed to be there the fifth, 
 and he said, 
that the lady told him, 
that it usually takes  a week, 
 for them to send a report in, 
and  for their license to come back. 
 (H) So, 
 he anticipates that they'll be open no later than the twelfth to fifteenth, 
(H) he gave me some numbers, 
I can't remember, 
they've got like, 
(H) thirteen or fourteen kids they're already taking care of, 
 mostly out of their house, 
until they can get em moved down there, 
and then they've got eight or nine more. 
(H) So they fully expect income  to exceed the projection, 
 but right now they don't have any income, 
other than from  his job. 
So, 
(H) uh=, 
 [XXX] 
JIM: [That's fairly] large scale. 
 What -- 
 [And he's gonna have twenty]-five people, 
JOE: [(TSK) (H) The building is] -- 
JIM: or [2something2]? 
JOE: [2Yeah2]. 
 [3At l3] [4east twenty4]-five [55] children. 
FRED: [3Yeah3]. 
JIM: [4Twenty-five4] -- 
FRED: [5See they're e-5] -- 
Yeah. 
They're expecting that many f=airly quickly. 
And then, 
he hopes to get up  around fifty. 
FRED:  See they're looking at four people, 
plus=, 
JOE:  (H) [I've gone through the build]ing, 
FRED: [you know, 
plus his wife]. 
JOE:  and it is= uh, 
 a r- very  very nicely done .. operation. 
I mean there's nothing (H)  shoddy about the workmanship, 
or the quality of the material, 
or (H) the cleanliness of the, 
 of the building. 
[XX] 
JIM: [Is it at]tached onto a storage facility? 
JOE: (H) No. 
It's [a separate building]. 
JIM: [Oh it's free-standing] building. 
FRED: [2Yeah2]. 
JOE: [2Separate2] building. 
FRED: [3See it's a3], 
JIM: [3They3] -- 
FRED: It's a building his dad had, 
 where he was -- 
 where he had his & 
JOE:  his cabinet sh[op]. 
JIM: [O][2kay. 
FRED: & [2shop, 
and2], 
JIM: Okay2]. 
FRED:  And was living in it, 
and they converted the living quarters and all that into this thing. 
(H) It's like anything, 
when you're dealing with th- -- 
 you know, 
regulators and the state, 
 they, 
(H) you know, 
he said they got two ladies for nine counties, 
and they -- 
 There's a lot of this going on, 
and they can only get to so many. 
So, 
(H) I would mo=ve, 
 since it's secured for forty-five hundred, 
it's on a twelve-month repayment, 
which is relatively short, 
(H) I would move that we  advance the funds. 
KURT:  I'll second it. 
 Except, 
 they owe pretty much, 
don't they? 
FRED:  Three-hundred three thousand, 
 and some odd dollars. 
 But he's always serviced, 
 I mean, 
he's never been late, 
he's always paid as agreed, 
(H) uh, 
 and they do have . the income, 
it just, 
right now, 
the income doesn't -- 
 Well, 
 I say they have it. 
(H) O=nce the daycare gets up to twenty people, 
they'll have enough [inc]ome to, 
KURT: [Mhm]. 
FRED: (H) They'll fall back under the forty percent, 
But right now they're over the forty, 
because we st- can't show any income from the daycare. 
 (H) Um, 
 but, 
 you know, 
it it -- 
 you know, 
I feel comfortable that it's there, 
and like I say, 
he's always serviced debt as agreed, 
and, 
 and his overall debt  is working down, 
it's just quite a bit of debt. 
KURT: (H) You just, 
I guess you can't say too much if they're (H) paying on time. 
Uh uh, 
FRED:  Yeah. 
KURT:  and, 
FRED:  And I think they're about [to the point] -- 
KURT: [as long as everything] works out good, 
JOE: (H) 
KURT: (H)[=] 
FRED: [Yeah], 
I think if th- -- 
you know, 
th- th- -- 
 He's already talking, 
if this thing goes like they think it is, 
next fall he's wanting to, 
 start looking at expanding that  storage facility. 
(H) It's one of those things, 
I think there's -- 
 they're always gonna have .. (H) quite a bit of debt, 
so long as cash flow'll keep up with it. 
 Cause, 
you know he's -- 
 that's= kind of their, 
(H) you know he's looking at that as his retirement income, 
and an investment, 
and this whole bit, 
you know, 
like some of the people do here. 
JIM:  % Well it's been moved and seconded, 
 um, 
 to approve, 
but  that, 
 % we can't really disburse on that. 
 That, 
 due to his size, 
 (H) [of the loan], 
JOE: [until we have] all -- 
JIM: They [2need f-2] [3 f-3] -- 
KURT: [2all the board2] [3members3]? 
JOE: [3majority of3] board member. 
FRED: [4Yeah4]. 
JIM: [4Four4] -- 
 uh f- -- 
At least two more board members, 
[because] I'm voting, 
FRED: [Yeah]. 
JIM:  all in -- 
 I'm voting .. in [favor of it], 
FRED: [In favor], 
JIM: and, 
FRED:  Yeah. 
 [<X See I was X>] -- 
JIM: [since you sec]onded it, 
I assume so are [2you2]. 
FRED: [2Yeah2]. 
KURT: Yeah. 
FRED: So see I've got two -- 
and then I'll try to, 
(H) I'll get hold of two more. 
I was gonna see ~Wilbur, 
but he didn't -- 
s-  ~Dave didn't get in here until, 
 after he was gone, 
 so, 
 that's the only one I have. 
JIM:  Any other loans. 
JOE:  No other loans to be discussed. 
JIM:  I got a  couple things here, 
but uh, 
 we'll um, 
 the one, 
 is in regard to, 
 the retail, 
 nondeposit investment, 
(H) just to kind of bring us up to speed, 
(H)  m- .. ~M=att has tentatively accepted our  offer for employment, 
 but since he's going to be a dual employee, 
 th- -- 
you really don't need to put this in the minutes. 
[XX -- 
JOE: [Hm. 
 Okay]. 
JIM: I'll I'll c-] -- 
I'll catch up  the board up to speed, 
I just want us to know, 
because (H) it has some loan relevance. 
(H)  Uh= he was interviewed by LCL, 
!Larry !Harb interviewed him over the telephone yesterday (Hx), 
and, 
 !Larry called me this morning, 
 that's who had called about seven-thirty, 
and said everything went fine. 
(H) U=m, 
 (TSK) what -- 
 what we have set up is, 
~Matt's going up to Chicago, 
(H) at LCL's office, 
 on uh, 
 for  Monday evening, 
 Tuesday, 
(H) and Wednesday training. 
 The f- -- 
The Monday evening and Tuesday training, 
(H) will be very specific for him, 
(H) their workflow, 
their forms, 
he'll get to meet these people. 
(H) On Wednesday then, 
he'll be in a little bit of a larger group, 
 (H) there may be four or five other asset managers with him, 
(H) discussing sails  motivations and, 
(H) and  and sales approaches and strategies, 
(H)  % . !Larry said, 
Ph- he doesn't know how ~Matt's gonna plug into us, 
 philosophically, 
and how well he's known in the area. 
 He said that's our decision. 
 Of which, 
 I- you know, 
I'm comfortable with. 
(H)  I wanted !Larry to tell me how he thinks he's gonna do, 
plugging into the selling, 
and he said oh, 
you -- 
he should be -- 
he should do very well. 
 So I- I'm, 
um, 
tho- -- 
 that looks good. 
 (H) What I did, 
 kind of, 
 (H) in regard to that, 
was, 
 and, 
 I don't have this date finalized, 
but, 
(H) s- -- 
 I'm trying to go maybe the second week .. of .. January, 
(H) to ha=ve  a representative of Bankers Systems, 
(H)  come <<THUMP ++here THUMP>>. 
 to do some specialized training, 
 within the qualified retirement plan . area. 
 ~Matt needs, 
(H)  ~Matt .. needs an understanding of, 
 not a detailed understanding, 
but how all these qualified plans work, 
 (H) so that he w- . can have, 
 so he understands how, 
(H) his products plug into the (H) to the self-directed IRAs, 
SEPs, 
and the like. 
(H) We also, 
 it would do us .. good to know what products we can offer, 
(H) under those qualified retirement plans. 
(H) So, 
 uh R- -- 
!Ray !Galino I I believe is his name is, 
(H) supposed to come down, 
 I haven't set up a date, 
(H)  but, 
 he'll be here  on a f- -- 
for a day, 
and I wanted him to talk with ~Matt, 
(H) ~Vivian, 
myself, 
 and, 
 sometime during the day to the two of you. 
(H) Because as loan officers, 
(H) you have a good (H) handle on  borrowers and, 
 and can kind of tell them of these SEPs, 
and some of the other products. 
(H) Uh, 
we've kind of hesitated [in  in offering those], 
X: [(H)=] 
JIM: (H)  well, 
we have not offered the self-directed. 
JOE: [Hm]. 
JIM: [(H)] Offering the self-directed we're getting, 
is simply, 
(H) we need to get a dif- -- 
fifty different forms. 
 Instead of (H) called an IRA, 
 it's called an IRA SD, 
 for self-directed. 
 And then, 
 that will allow people, 
(H) to, 
 if they don't want .. all their funds in .. a bank CD, 
as  as are custodial IRA arrangements. 
See, 
the existing IRA says, 
(H) all those funds have to be in First National Bank of ~Hillsdale. 
(H) The self-directed, 
 the  the participant signs a (H) an investment ... direction, 
 or, 
 where where . he directs ... the investments. 
 They sign the form, 
[and then you invest in whatever they want] to. 
JOE: [Yeah. 
XX XXX]. 
JIM: (H) Uh=, 
 the, 
 what. 
How that works like with the SEPs, 
(H)  the SEP . has a vehicle, 
 has to be connected to the IRA. 
 So we take the SEP off the shelf, 
 and then if the person  wants that money put into a bank CD, 
(H) then we just use our custodial  IRA forms. 
(H)  If .. they want a self-directed i%-  SEP, 
(H) you take the same  SEP form off, 
(H) but you're using a different (H)  IRA. 
 You're not using [the custodial] IRA arrangement, 
FRED: [Oh, 
okay]. 
JIM: (H) % An SEP must have an IRA (H) attached to it. 
 [So that-] -- 
FRED: [So, 
the IRAs] all fit in the same  plan. 
 They're just different  ch- boxes checked off of this overall ... plan. 
And that, 
 the overall plan is what you're talking about goes back, 
that's what the IRS has blessed. 
JIM: Right. 
They -- 
FRED: is the framework, 
and so long as you stay within the framework in some combination, 
you're okay. 
JIM:  Exactly. 
(H) So, 
 I .. I had [talked with] .. with !Rick uh !Brady today, 
FRED: [(THROAT)] 
JIM: (H) and, 
 he's gonna send me those forms, 
so we can take a look at em, 
 (H) The other -- 
The thing which makes it a little more complicated, 
but (H) it's really not a cost, 
(H)  it's kind of a s-  flip-flop, 
in that, 
(H) he recommended we don't try and do the account maintenance on those self-directed IRAs ourselves. 
(H)  Because of how complicated [the law] is in all this, 
FRED: [Mhm]. 
JIM: so, 
FRED: [Mhm]. 
JIM: [(H)] 
 I mean, 
 coincidentally Banker Systems offers a comprehensive [account] [2(H) maintainance2] services, 
FRED: [@@] 
JOE: [2You're kidding2]. 
JIM: [3Isn't3] [4that4] [5XX5] -- 
FRED: [3@3][4@4] 
JOE: [4Well, 
is4][5n't that5] a surpri=se? 
FRED: [6@  @6] 
JIM: [6That- that's such6] a surprise. 
JOE: Yeah. 
FRED: [@  (H) .. @= @@] 
JIM: [And, 
 what- what- what we would do is], 
 they would take care of the account [2maintainance2]. 
FRED: [2(Hx)2] 
JIM: (H) In a similar manner, 
if you will, 
a=s (H)  they take care of the, 
 the other qualified plans. 
JOE:  Mhm. 
JIM: (H)  We- -- 
They- -- 
 We send them the information, 
[th-] -- 
JOE: [But they] print it, 
[2and2], 
JIM: [2They2] -- 
They crank out [3the numbers3]. 
JOE: [3qualify it, 
and3], 
JIM: (H) And, 
 and they [file whatever] needs to be filed. 
JOE: [disclose it], 
[2Mhm2]. 
JIM: [2(H)2] The -- 
 It's really not gonna cost us, 
it it's gonna be pretty much of a swap. 
Right now, 
(H) we use their eight-hundred number, 
 a=nd  their, 
 uh, 
 fi- -- 
 their newsletter. 
 for the IRAs. 
 We don't have their comprehensive service, 
we have their IRA service. 
(H) And that runs about three-hundred dollars a year. 
 If you= go to the comprehensive account maintenance, 
 the eight-hundred number is included, 
and the f- -- 
and the newsletter is included. 
 So we would drop three-hundred dollars off. 
(H) The account maintenance, 
 comprehensive account <X maintenance X>, 
 maintenance would cost us five-hundred dollars. 
(H) But, 
 what you do= is, 
 they- -- 
 he estimates it'd be five-hundred dollars, 
for a minimal number of accounts, 
(H) Banker System charges thirty-five dollars  an account. 
 And he said under a self-directed arrangement, 
 he's seen . charges, 
 to maintain a self-directed IRA, 
 anywhere from forty (H) to a hundred fifty dollars. 
Now I think a hundred fifty dollars (H) is a lot, 
(H) [to maintain] a self-directed IRA. 
FRED: [Mhm]. 
 [2So you mean2], 
JIM: [2%=2] -- 
FRED:  that you -- 
w=e could pass that back to the customer? 
 [That's] what you're saying, 
JIM: [Right]. 
Right. 
[(H) We] -- 
FRED: [They] charge us five-hundred plus thirty-five per account? 
JIM:  Well he- he thought -- 
he's gonna send me down the information, 
you know how the typical salesman, 
they, 
(H) they they d=- [talk in] kind of nebulous terms, 
FRED: [Yeah]. 
JIM: [2but he2] thought, 
FRED: [2Okay2]. 
JIM: (H) w- they -- 
 they have a minimum (H) number .. of accounts, 
 %= 
FRED:  Oh, 
with w- -- 
 is covered if you will by the five-[hundred. 
JIM: [(H) Yes]. 
FRED:  Okay]. 
JIM: And so he said, 
(H)  % % % way I understood it would, 
 let's say five-hundred would would cover the eight-hundred, 
 which is very very helpful service, 
FRED: [Mhm]. 
JIM: [(H)] and uh, 
 the  maintenance for let's say twenty accounts. 
 Well, 
 if we had [..] ten accounts, 
FRED: [Okay]. 
JIM:  we would charge (H) % .. five-hundred fifty dollars on ac- on an account, 
it would be five-hundred dollars, 
it's really kind of a switch around but, 
(H) what  what that would -- 
 I think it would be good for (H) .. the five or six of us, 
(H) to, 
 to have !Galino down here, 
(H) can kind of explain what products, 
 we can offer from the bank side, 
JOE:  Hm. 
JIM: ~Matt needs to know that, 
and  and we all need to know that, 
(H) and then, 
 we can figure out how ~Matt's, 
 the products that LCL's gonna offer will plug into that. 
 And it's -- 
 I was thinking of sending ~Matt up there for a week, 
(H) but, 
(H)  you know he's up there a week, 
he's gonna learn a lot of very technical  information, 
such as like those section four-fifteen (H) XSes. 
 That .. @that I was talking about. 
(H) You really don't need to know the (H) the technical (H)  
nitty-gritty  about it, 
 because, 
 that's what Bankers Systems does. 
[They] take care of the nitty-gritty, 
JOE: [Hm]. 
JIM: So, 
(H) it's gonna be less expensive, 
 to have  !Galino come here, 
 instead of one person going up to  to Minnesota for a week, 
 and then trying to bring back the information, 
 we're gonna have !Galino come down here for a day, 
 and, 
he won't -- 
 he won't touch any (H) specific .. complicated .. items. 
 Such as four-fifteen XSes or, 
(H) or ACP testing or that. 
 Cause ~Vivian and I kind of know that, 
(H) but if we don't know that, 
JOE: (THROAT) 
JIM: like that four-fifteen [ uh] XS, 
FRED: [Mhm]. 
JIM: (H) I called the eight-hundred number, 
and  and they went through the explanation, 
where the IRS (H) changed  the the deduction. 
FRED:  Just a -- 
 Just a . question. 
 from a mechanics. 
(H) Who's gonna ho=ld the account. 
 Is LCL  gonna hold the account, 
is the bank gonna  ho- . hold the account, 
 Who act- -- 
 You know, 
you're talking about bank products, 
and  and LCL products, 
like before, 
the trust department, 
(H) if you will, 
held (H) the account. 
 That that's physically where it [was, 
JIM: [Mhm]. 
FRED: you know], 
Is (H) is it's -- 
 I%- %= .. is the plan .. % % gonna be in the bank, 
or will the plan be in LCL, 
or is the plan (H) % just kind of nebulous, 
JIM:  Well -- 
 well the .. the SEP and the IRA, 
(H) will- will be First National Bank of ~Hillsdale. 
FRED:  Okay. 
 [That's what I meant]. 
JIM: [But  but] tho- [2those2] -- 
FRED: [2They're2] bank products. 
 if you will. 
 We offer those, 
(H) and then LCL, 
if  w=ill have, 
 within that plan, 
they'll have things you can buy, 
if you want to direct it that way. 
 [If you] don't want a CD, 
JIM: [Tha- the-] -- 
FRED: or if you= want something else, 
(H) you could direct that, 
(H) that the monies be used to buy=  some mutual fund, 
or some bond fund or something. 
JIM: Right. 
[And how I] envision that then, 
FRED: [Okay]. 
JIM: (H) we would get  the  statement .. from LCL, 
 for the .. mutual fund holdings, 
(H) [let's say] the person also had a CD. 
FRED: [Okay]. 
[2Mhm2], 
JIM: [2Let's2] -- 
 You know, 
it doesn't matter [how <X they X> split it]. 
FRED: [Like we do now]. 
JIM: (H) And then  then, 
(H)  what what we would have to do is, 
 pull that information together. 
(H) We would get LCL's statement, 
 as of  the end of the year. 
What the income was, 
(H) and what the balance was, 
we would then have to, 
if they had a CD, 
(H) pull that in, 
we would report that (H) up to Bankers Systems, 
FRED: [Okay]. 
FRED: [(H)] and they would then combine that, 
 and produce the report. 
(H) It -- 
 That's why there's .. normally a cost in those self-directed, 
(H) because, 
 it's not, 
(H)  with our CDs now, 
(H) that information, 
 that's the whole account, 
 and whatever's out there on the .. on the retire-, 
on the RAP record, 
(H) just passes right up, 
 and  and the CD and the RAP information, 
r- [retirement] account  processing system talk together. 
FRED: [Mhm]. 
JIM: (H) When you get another vendor in here, 
like LCL, 
(H) we physically have to put the papers together. 
But it's not that complicated. 
JOE: [But the] name of his office is gonna be LCL. 
JIM: [S-] -- 
JOE: It's not gonna be First National Bank, 
(H) 
JIM: Right. 
 Right. 
JOE: [Anything]. 
JIM: [(H) The-] the -- 
 I got a f- -- 
Oh (Hx). 
Yeah, 
 I love  expansions of business. 
[It took me] forty-five minutes to get a phone number. 
FRED: [@ (Hx)] 
JIM:  [2The phone number by the way is2], 
JOE: [2For LCL. 
 Yeah2]. 
JIM: <<POUND +~five +~five +~five, 
 +~five +~five  +~five +~five POUND>>. 
 Is what the phone number will be. 
(H)  But, 
 this is .. things that, 
(H) I'm I'm  anxious for ~Matt to get here, 
because I'm getting, 
(H)  I'm getting tuckered out, 
[trying to]  get all these nitty-gritty things, 
FRED: [@@] 
JIM: It's not tough to get the phone number. 
(H) But see they need the phone number in order to order letterhead, 
JOE: [Mhm]. 
JIM: [(H)] in order to or-  % have business cards. 
(H)  LCL in [2..2] in Chicago needs that, 
FRED: [2Mhm2]. 
JIM:  to get that process [3going3]. 
JOE: [3Hm3]. 
JIM: [4Uh, 
JOE: [4(TSK) (H) Uh is there LCL4] accounts gonna be maintained here, 
JIM: cause cause actually4] -- 
JOE: I mean, 
or  is there gonna be a separate, 
(H) They're gonna have an account in Chicago, 
for the funds to pass through? 
Or is it gonna be passthrough funds here at the bank? 
Or, 
(H) is that %= -- 
JIM:  Well, 
 w- .. what we'll do is, 
 those'll probably wire transfer [out]. 
JOE: [Through Bolt]mans or something, 
JIM: Well, 
 through the Fed, 
what -- 
(H) I think what will happen, 
(H) but we -- 
 ~Matt'll find this out, 
and, 
I mean, 
we'll get involved in it, 
(H) and I'm -- 
I'm not -- 
 whichever way it goes is fine, 
but probably the most sophisticated way, 
(H) will be, 
(H) everyone who makes -- 
 who buys a fund, 
or whatever, 
 that money will go into a  a clearing account here. 
 And then, 
(H) we will, 
 either LCL will  will [ACH it .. out of us], 
JOE: [XX XX] 
JIM:  Or, 
 we'll physically wire it up there. 
 <%<X You know X>%>, 
there may be (H)  a hundred thousand dollars in there, 
which may represent  three people's, 
or four people's [] purchases, 
JOE: [Mhm]. 
JIM: (H) and then ~Matt faxes the paperwork up to LCL, 
 and they do the suitability testing, 
 and then they know . what products have been bought, 
 and then on the other side, 
 we do a wire transfer, 
 to physically get the money up there. 
I think [that's how it's gonna work]. 
FRED: [Si-  similar to Fannie] Mae. 
JIM:  Ex- ex- -- 
 [Uh yes]. 
JOE: [Mhm]. 
JIM: Sa- same- [2same-2] [3same type of thing3]. 
JOE: [2Yeah2]. 
FRED: [2We2] [3we  we collect3] [4monies, 
JOE: [4Custod4]i4]al ac[5count, 
FRED: [5we collect monies5], 
JOE: <X and X>5], 
FRED: put it in account, 
 and the=n, 
 we tell them how much of it is theirs, 
 and, 
 [by calling up] there, 
JOE: [XXX] 
FRED: and that dial deal, 
and then it-  they zap it the next day. 
JIM: Yeah. 
 I don't [know if], 
JOE: [Okay], 
JIM: (H)  % . like, 
 that's the same way that uh  American Express with the traveler's checks work. 
(H) When we sell Traveler's Checks, 
 we put that money in a clearing account, 
(H) and then ~Jo ~Anne, 
or ~Grace, 
or= ~Tom, 
or somebody calls, 
(H) whosever doing that job, 
 calls [(H)] a number, 
FRED: [Mhm]. 
JIM:  and, 
 we report, 
 how much .. in (H) sales we had, 
(H) and they d- -- 
 they d-  hit the account the next day and take the money out. 
But that's -- 
(H) that's kind of the  the mechanics of the .. of the flow of funds. 
(H) But, 
to answer your question ~Joe, 
is that, 
(H) LCL, 
 that office .. will .. not say First National Bank of ~Hillsdale, 
 % or [anything of the nature]. 
JOE: [Anywhere. 
 Yeah]. 
JIM: (H) Uh, 
 the -- 
 his (H) his card will be= LCL investments, 
(H) at First National Bank of ~Hillsdale. 
(H) U=m, 
 l=etterhead will be LCL, 
 there needs to be a  separate phone line, 
 <<POUND +going  to +that +office POUND>>. 
(H) And we'll -- 
we'll be able-, 
when we get this receptionist set up, 
(H) the receptionist will also answer it, 
 but when they pick up the phone, 
(H)  you know we'll put it on a red line, 
or  blue line or something like that, 
(H) when they pick up that line, 
like we do with with with ~Bill's number, 
(H) you know they  they pick up, 
and they'll say LCL investments. 
(H) They also --\000000000 000000000 1602.72 1604.72 (H) and it's also requirements by uh, 
 uh %I guess NASDAQ or whomever, 
(H) and the comptroller that, 
 they don't .. want us, 
(H) when that line rings, 
we're not gonna pick it up and go, 
hello, 
First National Bank of ~Hillsdale, 
and they go, 
(H) <Q oh yeah, 
I wanted to talk about a mutual fund, 
oh I'm sorry, 
yeah, 
you do have LCL (H) in- investments Q>. 
I mean, 
these are [some of the] nitty-gritty things, 
JOE: [(TSK) Yeah]. 
They (H) they talk about in the regulation, 
and I'm pretty confident they'll  they'll implement those out. 
[But], 
JOE: [Is ~Matt] gonna carry on  his  other livelihood that he had before, 
 through that office? 
Or, 
(H) [is he] totally out of the insurance business. 
JIM: [N=], 
(H) He was meeting with- -- 
they had a regional meeting-, 
or, 
meeting with their regional manager today, 
(H) and he was going to  to tell him, 
(H) that, 
 he's plans to take a job here. 
(H)  C- Common courtesy says, 
that he (H)  % needs to give em two weeks notice. 
(H)  But, 
 the- .. the practice within the .. the industry, 
and !Larry -- 
 ~Matt said this, 
and also !Larry !Harb said this. 
(H) So, 
 I know it's not (H) .. ~Matt's employer, 
it's just within that industry, 
as soon as a person says, 
(H) I've decided to move on to another -- 
(H) another uh  uh  [customer], 
JOE: [XX] 
JIM: or an- another  [2employer2], 
>ENV: [2((DOOR_KNOCKING))2] 
JIM:  ni- -- 
Come in. 
>ENV: ((DOOR_OPENS)) 
VIVIAN: Did you need to talk to ~Genevieve. 
JIM:  N- % I'll g- -- 
 see if she's gonna be, 
at a number where I could talk to her in maybe a half an hour or [forty-five] minutes, 
VIVIAN: [Okay]. 
JIM: (H) Or else I'll give her a call tomorrow. 
VIVIAN: Okay. 
JIM: (H) Um, 
>ENV: ((DOOR_CLOSES)) 
JIM: as soon as they get notice, 
 they typically= say well fine, 
(H)  thanks for the two weeks notice, 
but it's effective today. 
(H) And then they electronically  transfer=  his licenses, 
 to his- -- 
 to to LCL. 
JOANNE: But, 
so these slides <X should X> be real interesting. 
KEN:  Yeah. 
I think it'll be real interesting 
I think it'll be a real, 
(H) a good slide show. 
 Too bad you can't make @it. 
LENORE :  (TSK) Who else do you know that's been there besides  what's her name. 
KEN: (TSK) (H) % [Just ~Jessie and] ~Shana, 
JOANNE: [~Shana, 
her], 
KEN: that's all. 
 Yeah, 
~Shana's, 
sort of, 
JOANNE:  (H) I wanna go. 
 [(H) But-] -- 
KEN: [I'd like to] go al[2so, 
JOANNE: [2It's an interesting2] thing. 
KEN: but2], 
JOANNE:  Hunh? 
KEN:  I'd like to go. 
JOANNE:  (H) It's an interesting thing though, 
because, 
um, 
(TSK) I'm wondering, 
 you know, 
since it is such -- 
(H)  0m=, 
 (H) it's restricted, 
you have to go through Mexico. 
KEN:  (TSK) No. 
I don't [think so. 
JOANNE: [Isn't Nicara]gua one of the things you -- 
KEN: No]. 
JOANNE: [2places you can't2] go? 
KEN: [2I don't think so2]. 
[3No, 
JOANNE: [3I think it i=s3]. 
KEN: we have -- 
No3], 
I don't think so. 
We have f- f- -- 
 (H) Technically speaking, 
 full .. diplomatic re[lations with] Nicaragua, 
JOANNE: [Oh yeah=]? 
KEN: Yeah, 
they have an, 
an ambassador, 
and, 
 you know an [American ambassador there, 
JOANNE: [(H) I -- 
then why does everybody always have to go through Mexico]. 
KEN: who -- 
(H) like a nest of CIA spies]. 
(H) That's just -- 
there -- 
there isn't a direct transportation. 
[but there n- -- 
JOANNE: [I thought, 
KEN: it's not, 
JOANNE: no, 
but I thought it w-] -- 
KEN: (H) it's] not like going to Cuba. 
 [2Where they have to make2] connections through [3Mexico because, 
JOANNE: [2Oh=2]. 
[3I knew someone who went to Cuba3], 
KEN: (H)3] 
JOANNE: and had to go, 
KEN: [yeah]. 
JOANNE: [make] connections [2through Mexico2]. 
KEN: [2(H) That's because2] it's il[3legal for3] Americans to travel [4to Cuba4]. 
JOANNE: [3(H)3] 
[4(H) But I won4]der whether this -- 
% It i=s. 
KEN: Yeah. 
It is. 
[XXXX]. 
JOANNE: [Oh yeah=. 
Just] like Lebanon just became. 
LENORE:  [2how long -- 
JOANNE: [2They say Lebanon <X is X>2] actually, 
LENORE: how long's2] -- 
JOANNE: they- -- 
it d- just beca=me illegal. 
 and- and- I- -- 
you know. 
KEN:  (H) For a few [years], 
LENORE: [how long] [2has it been illegal2]. 
JOANNE: [2Libya, 
too2]. 
Isn't Libya as well? 
There's quite a few pla- -- 
Liby[a], 
KEN: [(TSK)]  There's only a -- 
% there's only a handful [of places. 
LENORE: [How long has it been illegal for Americans to] -- 
KEN: (H)= (Hx)] 
LENORE: [2go to Cuba2]. 
KEN: [2Well, 
JOANNE: [2Since the2] [3fif- -- 
KEN: it was il2][3legal, 
JOANNE: since the fifties, 
KEN: it was illegal, 
JOANNE: or the sixties3]. 
KEN: it3] was illegal, 
 you know, 
from like the  time of Cath- -- 
 the Castro revolution, 
up until, 
I think the early seventies, 
the Supreme Court, 
(H) overturned  % travel restrictions, 
on the um, 
 (TSK) on the passport, 
(H) and said that the= government couldn't, 
%  really, 
 permit you from going anywh- -- 
uh, 
prevent you from going anywhere, 
(H) And the=n, 
(H)  [tha=-] -- 
JOANNE: [(TSK)] 
KEN: that changed again, 
a few years later they passed some laws, 
or something like that, 
which d=id enable the government to, 
 to do um, 
 visa res- .. restrictions, 
and, 
(H) I think Cuba, 
and North Korea, 
JOANNE:  Now Leba[non], 
KEN: [And now Le]banon, 
and Libya, 
JOANNE:  Unhunh. 
KEN:  are the only places that uh, 
(H)  maybe North- -- 
 maybe Vietnam also. 
JOANNE: X 
KEN: where [you], 
JOANNE: [X] 
KEN:  you're, 
 supposedly, 
n=ot able to use your passport to go to. 
 but, 
(TSK) (H)  you really. 
I mean you ca=n, 
JOANNE:  (H) [They know. 
KEN: [you know, 
JOANNE: (H) the thing is, 
what I'm wondering -- 
KEN: you can, 
like people go to Cuba all the time], 
JOANNE: what I'm wondering is], 
people that go to [2Nicara-2] -- 
KEN: [2and less o-2] -- 
less often [3to Nicar- -- 
JOANNE: [3(H) doesn't the State Department3]? 
KEN: to North- -- 
(H) to Vi3]etnam, 
and North Ko[4rea, 
JOANNE: [4Wouldn't the State Department know, 
everybody4] that went to Nicaragua. 
KEN: but people go to Cuba all the time. 
(SNIFF)4] 
P_Sure.

JOANNE: and], 
 cause it'll only eat it live. 
And so the snake, 
The bowl was about yea big, 
 you know, 
and then the snake would start to -- 
it would see it. 
 (H) And it would start to do this who=le little dance. 
It would start circling the bowl, 
<VOX and wrapping itself, 
and it would get faster and faster VOX>. 
(H) Then it would start s- -- 
it would start  moving, 
 (H) at the same pace that the snake would b- -- 
that the fish would be swimming. 
And it would start, 
 kinda following it. 
And going fast and fast, 
(H) It would be like this little whirlwind. 
You know? 
(H) And all of a sudden it would go  chk. 
 (H) And you know what's so funny. 
 The snake, 
 was v- --

I guess they're very bright about goldfish. 
(H) [Cause it], 
KEN: [@@] 
JOANNE: it would ra=rely get it, 
 it would rarely get the fish, 
it- w- -- 
by the fin. 
It would almost always get it by the head, 
because it was streamlined. 
Cause it would, 
it it would get it by the tail, 
(H) then the fins would all get -- 
it would be hard to swallow. 
Do you know what I [mean, 
LENORE: [Mhm]. 
JOANNE: It would get all] fluffed [2out2].

 the kids loved it.

JOANNE: (H) And she was this sensitive sweet little girl from uh Guatemala. 
Who was -- 
Actually her language was great. 
(H) And every time. 
You know what she would do-? 
The first time she did? 
 (H) She- she did -- 
 She crossed herself. 
She did the cross. 
(H) for the fish. 
KEN:  For the [Fish. 
JOANNE: [(H) And I asked her, 
why did you] do that, 
KEN: <X little fishy X>]. 
JOANNE: and she goes, 
so that the fish'll go to heaven. 
KEN: <VOX Aw=, 
<X was[n't X> that sweet VOX>]. 
JOANNE: [(H) And then], 
 from that point- -- 
and then she cried, 
 (H) And then from that point on, 
(H)  everybody would be sitting there, 
(H) looking at the fish anxiously, 
and I would have to  tell em to sit down, 
cause you know, 
% [others can't see]. 
KEN: [(TSK) @Calm @down]. 
JOANNE: calm @down. 
KEN: [@]

we had like language= les[sons] from it.

I would have it from=  the morning.

I'd pick it up the night before. 
Like, 
if it w- -- 
if we're feeding it, 
(H) I would pick it up Monday, 
 (H) I would take it home. 
 And that was the worst part. 
I would take it home, 
 and I would like put it in, 
I would leave it in its  plastic bag, 
(H) put it in a bunch of water. 
in the sink. 
and I wouldn't go near the sink. 
cause I didn't wanna look at this thing. 
 I didn't wanna get friendly with this fish. 
(H)  You know, 
(H) and then I would take it in, 
I would t- put it in its bag, 
and I would put it in a  paper bag. 
 And so I wouldn't look at it. 
 And I would put it like over by the sink in the classroom, 
all day-, 
you know, 
until it was feeding time. 
And I wouldn't look at it, 
and I wouldn't let the kids look at it. 
(H) Only when it was put into the bowl.

(H) But this time particularly sticks in my mind. 
(TSK) (H) He drops the goldfish into the tank,

minding his own little business, 
eating glop and all that shit,

that fish do,

TAMMY: [2(H) <X And I'm X>2] really basically I'm back for a tape deck. 
BRAD:  Oh ok[3ay3]. 
TAMMY: [3So=3]  u=m, 
 one of my thoughts is=, 
 that  u=m, 
 (TSK)  well, 
 I want a tape deck  that's gonna sound about, 
 you know, 
as good as it ca=n, 
BRAD: [Okay],

TAMMY: [(H) but] I've never done this before. 
I <X don't X> know much about tapes.

BRAD: [Okay]. 
TAMMY:  I have a  b=oombox,

BRAD: [Sure]. 
TAMMY:  (H) So, 
 I wonder if you would  suggest that this .. Luxman ... is the- --

BRAD: [%] 
 U=m, 
 (TSK) . the uh= --

 [That's its main purpose]. 
 In fact I wouldn't know what other purpose it .. %_would [ha=ve]. 
BRAD: [Oh] okay. 
The other benefit is=, 
 is if, 
 (H) you can load up two tapes in it, 
 like, 
let's say two ninety minute tapes [of music]. 
TAMMY: [Unhunh], 
 [2I see2]. 
BRAD: [2(H)2] And you can set a switch on [3it3], 
TAMMY: [3I see3]. 
BRAD:  [4where4] it will continually play, 
TAMMY: [4Okay4]. 
 Okay. 
BRAD:  all four sides, 
[of two tapes]. 
TAMMY: [I see]. 
 That's probably not gonna hap[2pen. 
BRAD: [2Okay2]. 
TAMMY: No2]. 
 It's mainly for copying. 
BRAD:  (TSK) [Okay]. 
TAMMY: [So], 
BRAD:  And the tapes you'd be copyi=ng, 
 uh=, 
 are they gonna be straight music? 
TAMMY:  M=mostly. 
BRAD:  Okay. 
TAMMY: Yeah. 
BRAD:  Okay. 
TAMMY: [Yeah]. 
BRAD: [So] you are gonna want, 
 (H) or desire a pretty  d=ecent=, 
 uh, 
 copy of your original [tape]. 
TAMMY: [Mhm], 
 [2right2]. 
BRAD: [2Okay2]. 
 (H) U=m, 
TAMMY:  And the originals will be from= music lovers,

 (H) pretty good systems. 
 [Not] -- 
BRAD: [Okay]. 
TAMMY: I'm -- 
we're not talking [stratosphere].

I mean how -- 
BRAD:  (TSK) 
TAMMY:  [X] -- 
BRAD: [Well], 
 you're you're gonna have that loss,

TAMMY: [Right]. 
BRAD: [f=-] from, 
 taking it from one tape,

TAMMY: [Right]. 
Right. 
BRAD: There's a lot of things in the signal path [there]. 
TAMMY: [Right].

TAMMY: [4(THROAT)4] 
BRAD:  u=m (Hx), 
 (TSK) couple different steps. 
(H) 
[Okay,

BRAD:  (H) u=m, 
 tha=t wou=ld,

 play the tape (Hx),

 [2Okay. 
BRAD: [2(H) Okay2], 
TAMMY: Right2]. 
BRAD: that would be your first level.

TAMMY: [2(THROAT)2]

 [Uh=], 
TAMMY: [mhm], 
BRAD:  They really put a lot into them, 
to be able to give that kind of warranty, 
TAMMY: m[hm], 
BRAD: [(H=)] and u=m, 
 (TSK) they're pretty conservative in their, 
 uh=, 
 specifications, 
where, 
 what they say their cassette decks will do, 
 they will . y- usually out perform that. 
TAMMY:  Okay. 
BRAD:  A=nd, 
w=ith the unit you already have, 
the receiver, 
that has the full remote control, 
TAMMY: (TSK) [Right]. 
BRAD: [(H)] all the units=, 
uh=, 
you're looking at here, 
(H) will=, 
 uh=, 
 (TSK) . go along with [tha=t], 
TAMMY: [Mhm], 
BRAD:  and=, 
 u=m, 
 (TSK) as far as the remote control funtions go. 
TAMMY: [right]. 
BRAD: [Where] the [2remote2] [3control3] will [4control the decks4]. 
TAMMY: [2Right2]. 
[3Right3]. 
[4Okay4]. 
BRAD: (H) The decks [5come with5], 
TAMMY: [5(THROAT)5] 
BRAD:  what's called a DIN cable, 
 and that [plugs in]to= the unit you have now. 
TAMMY: [Mhm], 
 [2right2]. 
BRAD: [2(H)2] okay this is the kay one eleven. 
TAMMY:  Okay. 
BRAD:  (TSK) This would be, 
I guess you'd say the entry level, 
TAMMY:  [Right], 
BRAD: [(H)] to integrate into your system. 
TAMMY:  [2okay2]. 
BRAD: [2(H=)2] U=m, 
 (TSK) .. this gives you, 
 a lot of pluses that, 
 most people's basic decks don't have. 
TAMMY: [Hm]. 
BRAD: [(H)] Okay=, 
it has Dolby, 
TAMMY:  [Mhm], 
BRAD: [which] as you know, 
that's a circuit to cut the tap=e hiss, 
 [(H)] without cutting the high frequencies. 
TAMMY: [right]. 
 [2Right2]. 
BRAD: [2(H)2] And u=m, 
 % r=egular Dolby is Dolby B. 
 [That's] like u=m, 
TAMMY: [Mhm], 
BRAD:  (H) when you buy tapes at the Wherehouse, 
 [they're ..] in Dolby. 
TAMMY: [right]. 
 [2(THROAT)2] 
BRAD: [2(H) U=m2], 
(TSK)  in addition to that it gives you Dolby C. 
TAMMY:  [Mhm], 
BRAD: [(H)] When you're making your own tapes at ho=me, 
like let's [2say2] from the CD, 
TAMMY: [2hm2]. 
[3Mhm3], 
BRAD: [3(H)3] making a tape to play back on this tape [4deck4], 
TAMMY: [4mhm4], 
BRAD: you're gonna wanna record it in Dolby C. 
TAMMY: [mhm], 
BRAD: [That's] gonna sound sonically super[2ior2]. 
TAMMY: [2mhm2], 
BRAD: (H)  U=m, 
or if f=riends are recording tapes in Dolby C=, 
then you'll be able to play it back and it'll sound [right]. 
TAMMY: [Hm]. 
[2Okay2], 
BRAD: [2(H)2] Okay, 
so if something's recorded in Dolby B=, 
you wanna play it in Dolby B, 
 Dolby C, 
you wanna play it in Dolby C. 
(H) [You don't] want to, 
TAMMY: [Mhm], 
BRAD: (H) mix and match=. 
[Uh=], 
TAMMY: [okay], 
BRAD:  the- -- 
 It doesn't sound quite right. 
TAMMY:  [Nkay], 
BRAD: [(H)] So this gives you that, 
TAMMY: [2hunh2]. 
BRAD: [2(H)2] it [3also gives3] you what's called HX Pro. 
TAMMY: [3Okay3], 
 [4mhm4], 
BRAD: [4Wh=ich4] is a feature usually only found in, 
 r0h=, 
 r=eally expensive cassette decks. 
TAMMY: [Mm. 
 Hm]. 
BRAD: [(H=)] And that i=-  is, 
 (TSK)  an improvement in the recording section of it, 
TAMMY: [Hm]. 
BRAD: [(H)] and it allows you to record a [2little bit2], 
TAMMY: [2Mhm2], 
BRAD: u=m, 
higher record level, 
 so [you hear] less tape hiss, 
TAMMY: [mhm], 
[2m=hm2], 
BRAD: [2(H) and2] also= has a little bit more=, 
 u=m, 
high frequency= response. 
 [(H)] 
TAMMY: [Hm]. 
[2Mhm2], 
BRAD: [2Okay], 
so this one here you're looking at three hundred eighty dollars, 
TAMMY: mhm, 
 hm. 
 M[hm], 
BRAD: [O]ka=y, 
 (H) a=nd= .. u=m, 
 (TSK) .. from there=, 
 the next step, 
 for what you're looking at, 
(H) would be= the kay one ten. 
 (H) Okay the kay one ten basically has all functions that we just talked about on [the- on the kay] one eleven, 
TAMMY: [Mhm], 
BRAD:  (H) u=m, 
TAMMY: [(THROAT)] 
BRAD: [(H)] with the addition of, 
(H) the convenience feature of having auto reverse. 
TAMMY:  Yeah, 
BRAD: (TSK) (H) And that's ni=ce, 
just like [in the] car. 
TAMMY: [X], 
BRAD:  Where, 
TAMMY: [Yeah], 
BRAD: [(H)] it will play  %  side B=, 
after side A is finished, 
 [automatically]. 
TAMMY: [Yeah], 
BRAD:  [2Where2] you don't have to get up and [3flip the tape3]. 
TAMMY: [2(H)2] 
[3o3]kay. 
BRAD: (H) The other thing about it is, 
you can flip the tape over at any point  in [the middle]. 
TAMMY: [Mhm], 
 right. 
BRAD: (TSK) Uh=, 
(H)  a=nd, 
 the other thing=, 
 y- let's say if you're entertaining, 
 you can put in a ninety minute [tape], 
TAMMY: [Mhm], 
BRAD:  put it on continuous auto [2reverse, 
TAMMY: [2m= @mhm2], 
BRAD: (H)2] have a re[3cording of3] your favorite songs[4=4], 
TAMMY: [3right3]. 
[4M4]hm, 
BRAD: for a party, 
TAMMY: [right]. 
BRAD: [a] dinner party, 
whatever, 
TAMMY: [Right]. 
BRAD: [(H)] and, 
 play side A, 
then [side B then side A] side B, 
TAMMY: [Yeah, 
that's good]. 
BRAD: it'll just go forever. 
TAMMY: That's good. 
BRAD: [Okay]. 
TAMMY: [Okay]. 
BRAD: (H) [2U=m2], 
TAMMY: [2Right2]. 
BRAD:  (H) so that's [3what it gives3] you in the kay one ten. 
TAMMY: [3(THROAT)3] 
[4mhm4], 
BRAD: [4(H) (TSK)4] Now=, 
 the=, 
 d=ual, 
 or double cassette deck, 
 (H) that Luxman offers, 
(H) is basically, 
 a  u=m, 
 (TSK) double version  o=f the kay one ten. 
TAMMY: [Ri=ght]. 
BRAD: [(H)] And they call it the kay one ten double-u. 
TAMMY:  (TSK) Okay. 
BRAD: (H)  %  And- -- 
TAMMY: S=o what's the price diffe[rence here]. 
BRAD: [Oh okay, 
I'm sorry], 
 the- -- 
TAMMY: [Yeah]. 
BRAD: [the kay] one ten  is four hundred eighty dollars, 
TAMMY:  Alright. 
BRAD:  (H) and the kay one ten double-u=, 
is five hundred eighty dollars. 
TAMMY: Mhm, 
 [okay]. 
BRAD: [(H)] Okay. 
<X So you paid X> a hundred dollar premium for auto reverse=, 
(H) then you're [paying another hundred] dollars= to [2have2], 
TAMMY: [Yeah @], 
[2right2]. 
BRAD:  double [3cassette deck3] that's auto [4reverse4]. 
TAMMY: [3Okay3]. 
[4Mhm4], 
[5okay5]. 
BRAD: [5(H)5] Um, 
the convenience on this is obvious=. 
TAMMY:  [Mhm], 
BRAD: [(H) Whe]=re, 
 u=m, 
 [they even have], 
TAMMY: [(THROAT)] 
BRAD:  u=m, 
 you know, 
buttons set up [for], 
TAMMY: [Mhm], 
BRAD: (H) dubbing, 
 or copy[ing, 
TAMMY: [mhm], 
BRAD: from] one tape deck to the other. 
TAMMY:  mhm, 
BRAD: (H) U=m, 
 (TSK) . so it's really set up, 
 to [be] .. just cranking out, 
TAMMY: [hm], 
BRAD: (H)  uh=, 
 copies. 
TAMMY: m[hm], 
BRAD: [(H)] Now the other thing is, 
 it [2has a2] feature where it will do it in half the time. 
TAMMY: [2hm2]. 
BRAD:  [3Or high speed dubbing3]. 
TAMMY: [3Hm. 
Hm. 
Hm3]. 
 Hm. 
BRAD:  (H) Which is s=ometimes nice, 
 so it doesn't take the whole period of ti=me. 
TAMMY: [Right]. 
BRAD: [(H)] To make your copy. 
TAMMY:  [2Mhm2], 
BRAD: [2(H)2] And it will continue making the copy, 
you know, 
from side A then, 
and it'll flip over, 
TAMMY: Right. 
BRAD: and to side B. 
 (H) U=m, 
 (TSK) . so we -- 
we've talked about it, 
how % -- 
how it [has the] dubbing speed select buttons, 
TAMMY: [Mhm], 
BRAD: so you can make a=, 
 a [high speed] copy, 
TAMMY: [mhm], 
BRAD: (H) u=m, 
 (H) The other thing that sets this apart, 
from a lot of other dual de=cks, 
is it has a separate Dolby button, 
 (H) for each cassette deck. 
TAMMY:  (STIFLED_SNEEZE)  [Mhm=]. 
BRAD: [Ge-] -- 
uh  gesundheit. 
TAMMY:  @(Hx) @Thank @you. 
 (SNIFF)  (Hx) ... yeah. 
BRAD: U=m, 
 [where] a lot of units will, 
TAMMY: [Hm]. 
BRAD:  (H) just have a Dolby setting, 
TAMMY:  [Mhm], 
BRAD: [and] that's the same [2for both decks2]. 
TAMMY: [2(TSK) I see2]. 
[3I see. 
BRAD: [3(H) But there3] may be a situation, 
where a friend of yours, 
TAMMY: Yeah3]. 
[4Mhm4], 
BRAD: [4(H) who's4] a real audiophile, 
[5made5] uh -- 
TAMMY: [5mhm5], 
BRAD: a real premium tape for you, 
TAMMY: [mhm], 
BRAD: [recorded] in Dolby C. 
TAMMY: [2mhm2], 
BRAD: [2(H)2] Well, 
 you wanna record it in Dolby B, 
so you can play it back in your [Walkman]? 
TAMMY: [Mhm], 
BRAD:  and in your automobi[2le's cassette2] player. 
TAMMY: [2mhm2], 
 mhm , 
BRAD: (H) Uh=, 
 in that scenario, 
(H) you're gonna want to play it back in Dolby C, 
but recor=d it in Dolby B. 
[(H)] 
TAMMY: [Yeah]. 
 Okay. 
BRAD: O[kay? 
TAMMY: [That's] [2<X good X>2]. 
BRAD: [2So2] this [3gives you3] that convenience. 
TAMMY: [3(SNIFF)3]  [4Nkay4]. 
BRAD: [4(H)4] Now the other thing is, 
let's say, 
(H=) u=m, 
that friend of yours came over for dinner with his p=rize tape, 
TAMMY: [Mhm], 
BRAD: [(H)] and you had your prize= tape, 
TAMMY: [2mhm2], 
BRAD: [2of of some2]thing else, 
[3you3] could load them both up, 
TAMMY: [3mhm3], 
 mhm, 
BRAD: (H) put it on continuous, 
TAMMY: @ 
BRAD:  u=m, 
TAMMY:  [unhunh], 
BRAD: [(H)] auto reverse, 
 and it will play side A side B of [2one tape2], 
TAMMY: [2@@2] 
BRAD:  [3go over3] to the other tape, 
TAMMY: [3right3]. 
BRAD: and play [4/sed ai/4] -- 
TAMMY: [4Mhm4], 
BRAD:  side A, 
 then side B, 
 and [it con]tinually go forever. 
TAMMY: [right], 
 O[2kay2]. 
BRAD: [2(H)2] U=m, 
TAMMY:  Hunh. 
BRAD:  (TSK) [which is] kinda nice. 
TAMMY: [Wow]. 
BRAD:  Now the other [2thing 2] you can do with this deck= .. i=s, 
TAMMY: [2Yeah2]. 
BRAD:  (H) in your system, 
 you can make a copy, 
from tape to tape, 
 (H) while you're [listening to something else], 
TAMMY: [(BLOWS_NOSE)] 
BRAD:  n=[2kay, 
TAMMY: [2Unhunh, 
BRAD: so you could be listening2] to your CD, 
TAMMY: right2]. 
BRAD: [3while you're3] making a tape [4copy4]. 
TAMMY: [3Right3]. 
[4That's4] right. 
 O[5kay5]. 
BRAD: [5(H)5] Um=, 
(H) the other thing you can do is=, 
 (H) um=, 
 (TSK) as I recall (Hx), 
 one can listen [to] . (TSK) (H) the tuner, 
TAMMY: [(THROAT)] 
BRAD:  so you could put on [2(H)2] KDB, 
TAMMY: [2Mhm2], 
BRAD: or I -- 
[I-] --. 
TAMMY: [right]. 
BRAD: %=  <0r there's one= ~Matt likes, 
 I forget what it's called %>, 
 [but anyhow, 
TAMMY: [@@@ Right]. 
BRAD: (H)] um=, 
TAMMY:  [2(THROAT)2] 
BRAD: [2or he wants to2] get KFAC I think it is. 
TAMMY: [3Yeah3]. 
BRAD: [3(H)3] @@@ Which is kind of tough. 
Um=, 
(H) so you could be listening to the radio, 
 while taping a CD. 
TAMMY: Mhm, 
BRAD:  You- you know, 
TAMMY: [right. 
BRAD: [it allows you to do] that. 
TAMMY: Right]. 
 Right. 
 Okay. 
BRAD:  Which, 
 (H) [you have] to pay attention to <@ what you're [2doing @>, 
TAMMY: [Okay]. 
[2I know. 
That's right=. 
Yeah2]. 
BRAD: (H) @yeah2], 
 (H) but at least you have that flexibili[3ty. 
TAMMY: [3Okay3]. 
BRAD: (H)3] And [4so it sounds like4], 
TAMMY: [4(THROAT)4] 
BRAD: f=rom  what you've told me, 
 (H) uh=, 
%  you know, 
about you're desire to make=, 
 [good] quality copies of tapes, 
TAMMY: [Mhm], 
 [2mhm2], 
BRAD: [2(H) this2] is gonna be the tape deck, 
TAMMY: [3mhm3], 
BRAD: [3that3] would fit your needs. 
TAMMY: mhm, 
BRAD:  (TSK) And integrate well with your system=, 
[a=nd], 
TAMMY: [(TSK) right]. 
BRAD: allow the remote to fully control it. 
TAMMY:  Okay. 
Well what you've said helps me a lot. 
 I actually  may=, 
 I mean, 
I d=on't do this so often. 
 And it may well be that I -- 
 I'd do better, 
 just going back to one of these others. 
BRAD:  [Mhm], 
TAMMY: [Um=], 
 [2in2] -- 
BRAD: [2(TSK)(H) The oth-2] -- 
TAMMY:  in @fact, 
[I'm] -- 
BRAD: [the oth-] -- 
 the other thing I was gonna say is, 
is it -- 
(H) do you have, 
 um=, 
 (TSK) if you had some other type of quality cassette deck. 
TAMMY:  [Mhm], 
BRAD: [(H)] Even if it was a, 
(H) [2(H)2] unf=- -- 
TAMMY: [2mhm2], 
BRAD:  one in the office, 
[or uh], 
TAMMY: [mhm], 
 (TSK) [2yeah2]. 
BRAD: [2a port2]able or something like [3that3], 
TAMMY: [3mhm3], 
BRAD: (H) I could somehow hook it up into your system. 
TAMMY:  [mhm], 
BRAD: [So you] could tape [2from i=t, 
TAMMY: [2right. 
 Right2]. 
BRAD: (H)2] to, 
 [3one of3] these. 
TAMMY: [3Right3], 
 okay, 
 [that's possible]. 
BRAD: [(H) And], 
(H) the- -- 
the prices I gave you were the=, 
uh=, 
Luxman suggested prices, 
TAMMY: Right, 
BRAD:  (H) since you've bought 
TAMMY: m[hm], 
BRAD: [and also] been through the fire, 
 I'm sure [2we can2] (H) work something else out for you, 
TAMMY: [2mhm2], 
BRAD: I don't [3know=3], 
TAMMY: [3okay3], 
BRAD: (H) how well % (Hx), 
 0h=, 
 let's see here, 
 (H) . (Hx) um=, 
 the kay one eleven, 
(Hx) (H)  which is the= -- 
the basic one, 
TAMMY: Right. 
BRAD:  but  0h, 
 %I don't -- 
 When I say basic, 
 I mean basic in their line, 
TAMMY: [Right]. 
BRAD: [it's still] very good, 
TAMMY: [2Yeah2], 
BRAD: [2(H)2] uh=, 
 you'd be looking at three hundred [3forty-nine3] dollars, 
TAMMY: [3(THROAT)3] 
 nkay, 
BRAD:  (H)  The=, 
uh=, 
 (TSK) . let's see here, 
(H) the kay one ten, 
TAMMY: mhm, 
BRAD:  uh=, 
 we could do four hundred  and forty-five, 
TAMMY: (TSK)  right, 
BRAD:  (H) and the kay one ten double-u, 
 uh= we could do five thirty nine. 
TAMMY:  mhm, 
(TSK) okay. 
 Well, 
that looks great. 
BRAD:  And I th- -- 
 I belie=ve, 
 (H) there's one that we didn't talk about, 
and that's the kay one twelve. 
TAMMY:  M[hm], 
BRAD: [(H)] Okay, 
and the kay one twe=lve is basically (H) the audiophile's dream cassette deck. 
TAMMY: @@@ 
BRAD:  O[kay, 
TAMMY: [mhm], 
BRAD: it's a] -- 
(H) it's a single cassette, 
 and it's single direction, 
TAMMY: m[hm], 
BRAD: [where it] doesn't flip over by itself. 
TAMMY:  [2right2], 
BRAD: [2(H)2] What sets it apart, 
is it has three discrete heads. 
TAMMY:  [hunh]. 
BRAD: [Okay], 
(H) and this will make a superior tape copy, 
TAMMY: Hm. 
BRAD: (H) um=, 
 or a superior tape period. 
(H) [U]=m, 
TAMMY: [Hm]. 
BRAD: (TSK) because it has three heads. 
TAMMY:  [Hm]. 
BRAD: [(H)] And what it does, 
is that it has a separate head for record, 
 a separate head for play. 
 [(H)] 
TAMMY: [Hm]. 
BRAD: Where most decks have a combination record play head. 
TAMMY:  (TSK) Un[hunh]. 
BRAD: [(H)]  An=d %, 
 um=, 
(TSK) this also has some adjustments on it=, 
 uh= such as b=ias fine trim, 
TAMMY:  [Hm]. 
BRAD: [(H)] uh=, 
which allows you to, 
(H) tailor  the cassette deck's electronics, 
(H) to the specific tape you're using. 
TAMMY: M[hm], 
BRAD: [(H)] So obviously you can see there's % -- 
TAMMY: right. 
BRAD:  <@ a b- -- 
a bit more @> invol[ved with it. 
TAMMY: [Yeah. 
 Yeah]. 
BRAD: (H)] For the purist, 
 this is the way to go. 
 [<YWN Here you're] looking at six hundred dollars YWN>. 
TAMMY: [Okay. 
BRAD: (H)] 
TAMMY: Okay]. 
 (THROAT) 
 Right. 
 Okay, 
well this is very helpful. 
(H) [Let] me ask you one other thing. 
BRAD: [X] 
TAMMY:  Suppose that, 
(H) I wanna use this tape deck, 
to record, 
 um=, 
 conversation=. 
Like we do in -- 
<X in X> linguistics. 
 Between ~Matt and me, 
or something [like that. 
BRAD: [(TSK) (H) Okay]=. 
TAMMY: Then], 
 how does it work. 
 Let's say go back to the kay one ten. 
BRAD: (H) Uh[=, 
TAMMY: [Or the one] -- 
BRAD: there's] one deck here, 
I think, 
that's [s=et up for that]. 
TAMMY: [or the one el- el=even]. 
BRAD:  Let's take a look here. 
(H) The kay one ten, 
TAMMY:  [Mhm], 
BRAD: [(TSK) (H)] has provisions, 
for microphones, 
on the front. 
TAMMY: un[2hunh2]. 
BRAD: [2(H)2] And it's one of the few cassette decks=, 
TAMMY: [Okay3], 
BRAD: [3made3] for the consumer hi fi [4market4] today, 
TAMMY: [4@(Hx)4] 
BRAD: that do have that. 
TAMMY: o[kay=]. 
BRAD: [(H=)] A=nd so=, 
(H) you can plug in one microphone, 
TAMMY:  Yeah. 
BRAD: (TSK) uh=, 
where it has a position=, 
 uh=, 
that's mono, 
TAMMY:  Mh-[hunh]. 
BRAD: [(H)] and it will record it on both [2tracks of2] it, 
TAMMY: [2Mhm2], 
BRAD: [3%- -- 
TAMMY: [3mhm3], 
BRAD: and then3] if you want, 
TAMMY: [4hm4]. 
BRAD: [4you can4] plug in two mics, 
(H) and it senses when [5you5] plug in the [6second6] mic, 
TAMMY: [5Hm5], 
[6(TSK)6] 
[7okay7]. 
BRAD: [7and so7] it'll record in ster[8eo8]. 
TAMMY: [8(TSK)8] 
Okay. 
BRAD: (H) And then it has a record level on it, 
TAMMY: Hm=[hm], 
BRAD: [so you] can adjust the record le[2vel, 
TAMMY: [2mhm2], 
BRAD: depend2]ent on how loud you're talking, 
TAMMY:  [3mhm4], 
BRAD: [3(H)3]  an=d then also the type of tape you're using, 
TAMMY: m[4hm4], 
BRAD: [4and the4] level you want on the [5tape5]. 
TAMMY: [5hm5]. 
 Hm. 
BRAD:  (TSK) Uh=, 
(H) so the kay one ten w=ould be set up for that=. 
TAMMY: [Hunh]. 
BRAD: [(H)] Any of the other, 
um=, 
cassette decks here, 
TAMMY: M[hm], 
BRAD: [(H)] (TSK) the kay one eleven has it too. 
[2I Take-2] -- 
TAMMY: [2hunh2]. 
BRAD: I- -- 
I take it back. 
TAMMY:  Huh. 
BRAD: I didn't think the kay ele- lev- [one eleven] did. 
TAMMY: [Unhunh], 
 [2unhunh2], 
BRAD: [2(H)2] O=kay it's the= -- 
 it's the dual one that doesn't. 
TAMMY:  okay. 
BRAD:  The dual one does not have those provisions. 
(H) now that doesn't mean that it cannot be done. 
TAMMY:  [Right]. 
BRAD: [(H)] What has to happen then is=, 
(H) uh=, 
 one=  (TSK) hooks up= (H) [a=], 
TAMMY: [Mhm], 
BRAD: a separate outboard piece, 
called a microphone amp. 
TAMMY: [okay]. 
BRAD: [(H)] Okay, 
and so what happens is, 
your mic runs into i=t, 
TAMMY: [Mhm], 
BRAD: [(H)] and then it plugs into your receiver, 
TAMMY: [2mhm2], 
BRAD: [2into one2] of its inputs. 
TAMMY: (TSK) [3okay=3]. 
BRAD: [3(H) And3] so one of your inputs on your receiver, 
TAMMY: [4(THROAT)4] 
BRAD: [4(H) let's say4] tape two, 
TODD: [5<YELL <X #Paul X>5], 
TAMMY: [5Mhm5], 
BRAD: would ac[6tually be6] a micro[7phone7]. 
TODD: [6run6], 
[7run7]. 
TAMMY: mhm, 
TODD: Yeah=[=]. 
BRAD: [And so] you would hit that, 
TODD: Y[2eah2]=[3=3]. 
TAMMY: [2mhm2], 
BRAD: [3and that3] would, 
 [4um=4], 
TODD: [4#Paul saved4] my [5ass5][6= YELL>6].

if you [wanted to] record a tape. 
TAMMY: [Right]. 
 Right. 
 Okay. 
(H) So= um=, 
 [%m]. 
BRAD: [(TSK)] So the kay one ten, 
 which is [2the single2] auto reverse, 
TAMMY: [2Yeah2]. 
BRAD: has the mic provisions, 
TAMMY: [Right. 
BRAD: [(H) the kay one eleven (H) has the] mic provisions. 
TAMMY: And so's the kay one -- 
Okay]. 
Great. 
 [O]kay. 
BRAD: [The b-] -- 
the benefit of the one ten? 
 The big benefit is the auto re[verse]. 
TAMMY: [Right]. 
BRAD: (H) U=m, 
TAMMY:  I'm one of these weird people that has trouble with auto reverse. 
BRAD: [(TSK) oh yeah]? 
TAMMY: [I don't] know why. 
The first time -- 
I mean, 
this is the first time I've had it, 
on my b=oombox. 
 (H) And for some reason, 
 maybe <@ I just have to learn, 
when I @> put the tape in, 
I never know which direction it's gonna go. 
 (H) So I have a hard time= finding -- 
(H) 
BRAD: [Wh=at you want]?

BRAD: [2Okay2]. 
(H) The way it [3usually works i=s3],

TAMMY: [Mhm],

we should have an enormous  supply of it, 
MICHAEL:  (H) yeah like, 
every light switch will have its own computer or something you know. 
 Basically, 
because it'll be cheap enough that, 
 cheap as a switch these [days or something, 
JIM: [it won't cost anything]. 
MICHAEL: you know]? 
JIM: ky- -- 
and it -- 
%and when they go into outer space, 
and start growing this  thi- those uh, 
(H) silicon chips without any flaw=s, 
MICHAEL: [Hm]. 
JIM: [(H)] they'll be able to uh, 
 grow circuitry that is so complicated, 
(H) that, 
 you know, 
 that gravity destroy=s it. 
so they'll be [able] to uh, 
MICHAEL: [Hm]. 
JIM: (H) [2uh2], 
MICHAEL: [2Yeah2]. 
JIM: % to- -- 
i- they'll be able to get these fanta=stic uh= c=ircuits, 
(H) f- like say for a whole television set, 
just on one chip. 
 (H) [A=nd uh=] 
MICHAEL: [(H) @@] 
JIM:  uh=, 
and then it'll harden out there, 
and k- they'll bring it back. 
 (H) %a-  uh, 
the whole [thing is] s=, 
MICHAEL: [(Hx)] 
JIM: is s=, 
 is so sensational. 
MICHAEL:  (TSK) That'll be expensive at first. 
JIM:  God. 
But [can you] -- 
MICHAEL: [growing em] in space, 
[2but that's2] great. 
JIM: [2yeah2]. 
it'll -- 
it'll uh, 
 [it'll] be worth it. 
MICHAEL: [In] -- 
(H)  This technology out of m=ost of, 
 uh m-, 
 anything in the pa=st, 
ha- has m- -- 
 it's becoming like we're shaping our= . our destiny, 
<X or X> ourselves. 
 u=m, 
 with this technology, 
more than we have in %  with any other in the past, 
it seems. 
(H)=  just b_like, 
whatever we think it b- % -- 
 we can .. make it. 
 (H) but there's one technology that's u=m, 
 gonna overtake that, 
and that's D=NA research. 
 which is=, 
like, 
a total scam at this point, 
still it's, 
they're just like, 
 bombarding  (H) 0rganisms with radiation, 
to see what comes up. 
 (H) you know. 
We have very little control over it. 
 But once we do=, 
 (H) we'll be able to progra=m biology as well. 
JIM:  (H) (TSK) Well tha=t's pretty frightening con[cept]. 
MICHAEL: [(TSK) (H)] It is frightening but, 
JIM:  We [can't even] control our freeways. 
MICHAEL: [um], 
(H) I know=. 
JIM: you know[=? 
MICHAEL: [(H)] 
JIM: I mean], 
MICHAEL: but, 
i- % -- 
the thing is, 
any s- technology that comes up, 
it gets used. 
 Once it's out there in [the open], 
JIM: [(H)] 
MICHAEL: the- -- 
JIM: Well [I hope] -- 
MICHAEL: [the so]ciety [2as a- a whole2], 
JIM: [2I hope they use fractals2]. 
JIM:  Are you familiar with fractals? 
MICHAEL: Unhunh. 
JIM:  Yeah, 
I hope they use a lot of fractals. 
Be[cause f=-] -- 
MICHAEL: [in biolo]gy re[2search2]? 
JIM: [2%2] 
% No. 
But in=, 
well, 
the connection between mathematics and biology, 
[can be] found k- -- 
MICHAEL: [unhunh]. 
JIM: uh, 
m=ore easily with fractals, 
than it can with uh [regular] mathematics. 
MICHAEL: [Yeah]. 
JIM: (H)[=]= 
MICHAEL: [Yeah]. 
JIM:  So, 
 (H) you know, 
I'm looking for the p- connection, 
between science and, 
(H) a=nd religion and, 
 and and [and bio]logy, 
MICHAEL: [mhm]. 
JIM: as it were, 
ar- -- 
th- you know, 
the living as spiritual, 
and the -- 
and the=, 

MICHAEL: [Like the ancient science were], 
JIM: [and the sci- -- 
and the scienti]fic, 
 [2Pardon2]? 
MICHAEL: [2it was2], 
like the ancient science, 
it was just  a branch of knowledge, 
which is- included [all knowledge] basi[2cally. 
JIM: [Alchemy]. 
[2alchemy. 
 Right2]? 
MICHAEL: (H) Unhunh2]. 
JIM: (H) [3yeah. 
MICHAEL: [3(H)= 
Whatever gets3] the job done. 
JIM: The- the-3] -- 
the ge[4stalt4]. 
MICHAEL: [4@4] 
JIM:  the totality i=s taken into account, 
as opposed to, 
(H) [as opposed] to the observer. 
MICHAEL: [Right]. 
JIM: (H) you know, 
(H) I remember, 
%m- back in the psychedelic days, 
there was this poster of the scientist. 
I've always been on a, 
 kind of a crusade, 
%  for scientific uh, 
(H) responsibility. 
Right? 
(H) And scientists are, 
(H) are taking such control over the world these days. 
(H) uh with their n-, 
 you know, 
not the scientists, 
but what they've invented. 
(H) And the way it's marketed, 
and the way we're d- -- 
 we develop needs for it. 
(H) And I remember this pf- cartoon I saw w-, 
 of, 
 of, 
 it was called The Scientist. 
(H) and it had this, 
 this wonderful stone statue, 
about twenty stories tall, 
of a naked ma=n, 
and a naked woman, 
 (H) intertwined with each other, 
hugging each other, 
full frontal, 
and their arms wrapped around each other, 
(H) and then they s- -- 
 they- they looked like they were so intertwined, 
and they spiraled down and, 
 and they're a s- -- 
 they're a statue. 
(H) [right], 
MICHAEL: [Hm]. 
JIM: made out of sto=ne. 
and they're, 
(H) and the whole b=ase of the statue is crumbling. 
 Right? 
(H) And it's just like rubble=. 
f- like from, 
 just below the knee=s, 
(H) down, 
was just kind of rubble. 
but the rest of it was all real clear, 
a few 0ttle -- 
 some of it was chipped off, 
you know, 
it was ol=d but, 
(H) and d- -- 
and down at the bo=ttom, 
of this, 
 this rubble, 
 was this little m=an. 
(H) who was a scientist. 
And he had this big magnifying glass. 
(H) and he was looking at the rubble. 
Looking [with his] head down, 
MICHAEL: [@] 
 Hm. 
JIM: not looking up at the statue, 
and seei=ng the lo=ve, 
and the the- the- symbol there, 
(H) but looking down at the crumbs, 
(H) you [know], 
MICHAEL: [Hm]. 
JIM: (H) at the rubble at the bottom. 
With his magnifying glass. 
(H)  an=d, 
 an=d, 
 to me that, 
 that always symbolized, 
kind of rather clearly, 
(H) the limitations of the scientific method. 
(H)  Whi- -- 
if it doesn't take into account, 
MICHAEL:  well, 
JIM:  the .. to- -- 
 the the the whole human experience, 
(H) and, 
 including, 
(H)  the .. unbelievable parts of it. 
 the parts that are just legend. 
and myth. 
and, 
(H)  a=nd uh=, 
 [alluded to=], 
MICHAEL: [you mean the theories]. 
JIM: and], 
and the psychedelic experiences, 
and the (H) subjec[tive], 
MICHAEL: [oh, 
on2] that side. 
JIM: you know=, 
and insanity=, 
[and, 
MICHAEL: [(H)=] 
JIM: What, 
I] mean, 
MICHAEL: [2well2], 
JIM: [2you know they2] -- 
MICHAEL:  % 
JIM: They've got to take ac- into account, 
MICHAEL: [%(Hx)] 
JIM: [(H)] uh, 
MICHAEL: but, 
 [you can't], 
JIM: [the East], 
with all its, 
with all its fantas[tic discoveries]. 
MICHAEL: [but you can't look] at the stars with a microscope. 
 (TSK) And science is a microscope. 
 Each  p_scientist has their, 
(H)  their field of um, 
 experti=se, 
 and if they're gonna go, 
 if they're gonna stretch out far enough into the% -- 
 the unknown. 
 where they can find something new. 
(H) They have to do it in a straight line. 
They can't [do it, 
JIM: [that's true]. 
MICHAEL: (H)]= in all directions at once. 
Because then you run into things that we already know. 
 (H) [So the problem is= communication between s-] -- 
JIM: [but they're doing it, 
 they're doing it with mathematics. 
Right]? 
 [2I mean2, 
MICHAEL: [2Well, 
JIM: n-  no2. 
MICHAEL:  but the comm-2], 
 problem is, 
 communication between the branches of science. 
JIM:  [mhm]. 
MICHAEL: [I think]. 
JIM:  (TSK) that's [2true2]. 
MICHAEL: [2cause2], 
(H) who's gonna  be able to hold, 
all that knowledge, 
and make the connections. 
JIM:  (H) Well, 
the philosopher=s, 
and the= spiritual leaders, 
an=d, 
I mean, 
cause, 
 f- the stuff can be understand, 
 understood, 
 The [goa=ls, 
MICHAEL: [(H)  Those people can tell you=], 
JIM: or the, 
 or the cutting -- 
cutting] edge, 
can be understand -- 
 understood intellectually, 
(H)[=] 
MICHAEL: [but] those people can't tell you the details. 
 they know the whole structure, 
[but see], 
JIM: [well the] -- 
MICHAEL: it's like both sides. 
You have to have somebody looking at the [details, 
JIM: [%y- got to have a leader, 
MICHAEL: and somebody looking at the -- 
(H)] 
JIM: and you got to have], 
a bunch of workers. 
(H) [You know]? 
MICHAEL: [Yeah]. 
JIM:  A[2=nd you gotta2] have somebody, 
MICHAEL: [2right2]. 
JIM: who d_isn't necessarily inclined to deal with the details that mu=ch, 
(H) who's guiding, 
those who are willing [to sit there, 
MICHAEL: [I guess that's the problem, 
JIM:  and make all the] -- 
MICHAEL: we don't have a] guider. 
JIM:  (H) yeah. 
there's no l-, 
there's no lead, 
or [there's no] focus. 
MICHAEL: [yeah]. 
JIM: (H) [2and2] -- 
MICHAEL: [2That's right2]. 
JIM:  a=nd uh, 
 you know, 
 I think, 
 I think that, 
 one of the reasons that there's been no focus is because, 
(H)  0h, 
everybody accepted the scientific method as the best too=l that we ha=ve, 
[(H) And] was kinda letting the scientific method be the -- 
MICHAEL: [Mhm]. 
JIM:  be the leader. 
(H) The= -- 
the- w- you know, 
 [just continue inventorying and], 
MICHAEL: [Well those people who are doing re]search. 
JIM:  continue inventorying, 
cataloging, 
%_experimenting, 
 You know. 
(TSK) documenting. 
 uh=, 
 uh=, 
whatever. 
(H) and, 
instead of=, 
 instead of uh, 
 uh coming at it from another direction. 
Trying to find, 
 trying to find, 
 uh, 
 trying to find way=s to, 
(H) to, 
like  with .. with Einstein for example, 
you know, 
(H) uh, 
it seemed to me, 
he was trying to f- -- 
T_he was ex-  per- -- 
experimenting with, 
(H) with new ways of doing things, 
you know, 
MICHAEL: [<X well X> thinking] about things. 
JIM: [(H) 0h-] -- 
uh and thinking about things, 
and he was trying to -- 
he w- -- 
I think he was ultimately trying to, 
 trying to discover the speed of his own thought. 
 (H) 
MICHAEL: Hm. 
JIM: You know, 
(H) <X I mean X>, 
%= he was like, 
really off into wonderful abstract notions, 
that [were all based] in a peaceful  world. 
MICHAEL: [(H)] 
JIM: You know? 
(H) that couldn't exist unless he was secure. 
that we had a peaceful world. 
or that  that .. peace .. was (H) part of it. 
Of  what he was  abou=t. 
(H) and, 
(H) so much of today's technology is soulless. 
and has nothing to do with peace, 
it has to do with, 
(H) just generally, 
 chewing up, 
 you know, 
consumerism basical[ly and], 
MICHAEL: [Mhm]. 
JIM: (H)  chewing up -- 
 ch- n- -- 
j- chewing up  new w- -- 
uh, 
chewing up the human experience, 
and turning it into, 
(H) some kind of consumer need. 
MICHAEL:  Did you ever get into Tesla? 
JIM:  (H) uh=, 
just, 
0.000000e+00ver so peripherally. 
MICHAEL:  He had a lot of real .. wacky ideas on .. big levels. 
He wanted a world power system, 
(H) that you could um, 
 tap into the air basically, 
and get power anywhere on earth. 
 (H) and um, 
 (H)[= y-] -- 
JIM: [that's what the] Tesla coil was about? 
MICHAEL: Yeah. 
 but, 
e- the problem was, 
that it, 
 it uh, 
(H) it interfered with um, 
(SWALLOW)  well, 
matter. 
@ @I mean, 
y- -- 
it was n=ot a clean broadcast system. 
Like everything in the room, 
if you had a Tesla coil in the middle of the room, 
all the metal objects would be receiving it constant[ly]. 
JIM: [M]hm. 
MICHAEL: (H)= So, 
 it wasn't really a very efficient either. 
 Because you'd have to have a- -- 
(H) an immense amount of power being broadcast, 
so that, 
a few points could receive, 
 you know, 
their share of it. 
 (TSK) [(H)] 
JIM: [now what] about, 
if they -- 
0- with the superconductor. 
Will that change all that? 
MICHAEL:  (TSK) I don't know. 
 He was dealing with it being  basically energy, 
and being sent through the air, 
uh you know=, 
like light, 
JIM: like, 
 yeah. 
Like tapping right into just the energy of the earth, 
or something. 
[<X alright X>]. 
MICHAEL: [yeah]. 
which doesn't really %  [2require2] a conductor. 
JIM: [2yeah may-2] -- 
MICHAEL:  you know, 
I mean light will go through a vacuum. 
 So, 
 % I think he was, 
 (H) I mean he va- basically invented the radio, 
 <% and stuff like that, 
you know %>. 
 (H) 
JIM: (H) It's pretty confusing to me (Hx). 
but uh, 
 yeah, 
those  those guys are the guys I think that are the heroes, 
uh, 
or, 
 that are the unsung heroes. 
(H) 
MICHAEL: yeah. 
JIM: You know, 
 the r- -- 
the= uh, 
(H) and s- -- 
and and business and, 
I mean this is a cliche, 
but, 
but business has always uh, 
 taken these works, 
and, 
 and manipulated em, 
either, 
 to their benefit, 
or, 
 to our benefit, 
or to our detriment, 
or something, 
f- based on economic, 
(H)  wh- .. what the obvious, 
or the & 
MICHAEL: hm. 
JIM: & more immediate econo[mic] -- 
MICHAEL: [(TSK) Right]. 
 it's like, 
well, 
 gee, 
yeah, 
I know 
I know how we can make money with this. 
 I mean you just do it. 
JIM: yeah. 
 (H) <X Well X> that's what I like about fractals. 
is because uh, 
(H) uh, 
 with= these new mathematical . formulas, 
(H)[= 
MICHAEL: [mhm]. 
JIM: even] though, 
 you know, 
 because it's mathematical, 
and it -- 
 I- .. it has to work I guess with= (H) numbers in it. 
 somew- some way. 
(H) uh, 
 it's opens a door into, 
 what appears to be all= the substance that's underneath the obvious. 
(H)  You know, 
MICHAEL: [hm]. 
JIM: [with] -- 
if if regular math is the obvious, 
(H) uh=, 
 these fractals seem to, 
 seem to represent, 
 everything= that numbers aren't. 
(H) [a=nd uh that's=] -- 
MICHAEL: [(TSK) Well, 
something that] numbers aren't. 
I don't think it's everything. 
JIM: (TSK) not everything. 
[but s- -- 
MICHAEL: [cause there are t-], 
JIM: but the first] window, 
into that. 
MICHAEL:  yeah. 
 (H) well, 
it -- 
like -- 
every theory is just like-, 
%  %_it's a window, 
and it's also like a model of um  reality, 
and it's really not reality. 
(H) And uh, 
 like a fractal can g=et really close at do- % -- 
like describing growth patterns, 
like a [plant or something. 
JIM: [Yes. 
 Yes. 
Right. 
 Right]. 
MICHAEL:  (H) Um], 
but, 
(H) it's still n-  not the totality of a plant, 
JIM: No it isn't, 
by any stretch. 
But for mathematics or for science, 
it's the- -- 
[it's an opportunity for them to -- 
MICHAEL: [it's the cl=osest th=ing we have]. 
JIM: (H)] to, 
yeah. 
To get closer to, 
(H) to the ch=aos, 
or the, 
[or the order] of chaos, 
MICHAEL: [Mhm]. 
Uh, 
(H) that exists uh, 
(H) uh= %a- 0h %as subtext, 
to our life, 
to our experience on this planet. 
And [when we're], 
MICHAEL: [Mm]. 
JIM: (H) and when we're say- -- 
 when we're going to, 
(H) uh, 
 say blow up the first atomic bomb, 
(H) and and and, 
we don't bother, 
to ask the American people, 
or the people of the world, 
if w- if if we mi=nd, 
MICHAEL: [@] 
JIM: [(H)] uh, 
if there's a chance you know, 
 cause they didn't know for sure, 
whether  it would de[stroy the universe or not. 
MICHAEL: [<@ Yeah. 
(H) Or not @>. 
@ 
JIM: (H) And], 
(H) It might] have started a chain reaction that just blew up [2the whole earth2]. 
JIM: [2That's right2]. 
And it might very well still have started that chain reaction. 
And that it's all happening in fractal country, 
(H) and it [has] -- 
MICHAEL: [Aah]. 
JIM: and it, 
and it's manifesting itself in, 
(H) in disharmony, 
(H) uh, 
 in, 
(H)  in the .. deterioration of the planet. 
We're all worried about the ozone, 
we're all worried about the uh, 
[(H)] 
MICHAEL: [Hm]. 
JIM: uh=, 
(H) th- cancer is everywhere, 
(H) [uh=], 
MICHAEL: [so you're saying it] might have done the sa=me ba=d thing, 
but in [a sort of more roundabout way=]. 
JIM: [it's just that the uni- -- 
except that the] universe is such a complex phenomenon, 
that it's so deep, 
it's f=or- -- 
f- the fabric that we= are witnessing, 
through m- science, 
and through any known ability to understand, 
MICHAEL: [Mm]. 
JIM: [(H)] is just a thin shell from how deep, 
(H) this phantasmagorical experience goes, 
(H) and that when they did that, 
it's possible that they started a chain reaction, 
at such a subatomic level, 
a sub sub sub [sub subatomic level, 
MICHAEL: [it's gonna take a while to crumble]. 
JIM: (H)] that it'll take a while before it, 
 it, 
(H) it r=eally, 
(H) you know, 
 vr- goes (ROAR)=, 
you know, 
and [just r=]=ips it apart. 
MICHAEL: [Yeah]. 
JIM: it might take, 
(H)  it might take, 
 %a- a few th- -- 
it might take  five hundred years. 
or a thousand years. 
MICHAEL: [Yeah]. 
JIM: [or] a hundred years. 
or maybe it's be- -- 
w- maybe in v- fifty years. 
(H) or it might never happen but, 
(H) it's -- 
to me=, 
(H) tha=t was scientific irresponsibility. 
(H) A=nd, 
w- without the knowledge of, 
 of f-, 
 what fractals symbolize, 
at this point, 
to me, 
(H) 0- uh, 
 they -- 
 w- -- 
they could make that decision easier. 
 And, 
(H) with the sci[entif-] -- 
MICHAEL: [fractals] could have [2made the de2]cision [3easier3]? 
JIM: [2(H)2] 
[3No3]. 
No. 
Without the knowledge of fractals. 
The decision was made easier. 
[If frac]tals were known at that time, 
MICHAEL: [oh]. 
JIM: (H) there might have been a little more caution, 
because there was, 
(H) [there's this window]. 
MICHAEL: [but fractals] don't uh, 
 don't imply any .. particular morals. 
JIM: (H) well they imply, 
no they don't imply morals, 
but they do imply that there's more than the obvious going on. 
MICHAEL:  Well all math does that. 
JIM:  Uh=, 
not to me=. 
 uh [<X it's X>] -- 
MICHAEL: [They're just] another system, 
that's all, 
 just another model. 
JIM:  it's, 
% to me it's a model, 
 it's .. it's a model into the fourth dimension, 
as opposed to, 
(H) [you know, 
MICHAEL: [Well, 
 actually, 
JIM: the third dimension]. 
MICHAEL: Ein]stein's theory is a model in the fourth dimension, 
and that's time. 
 (H) . Um, 
 but fractal can be applied to, 
 many dimensions or n- -- 
 or just, 
 I mean, 
any number of dimensions. 
it's basically, 
(H) taking something and dividing it up randomly. 
 or, 
 with some system. 
 (H) it's like nested, 
 (H) nested values. 
 basically. 
 Inside a gallon you have four quarts, 
inside of four -- 
 in-  inside a quart you have, 
the certain amount of cups, 
and then, 
you know. 
 (H) etcetera etcetera. 
 (H) 
JIM:  (TSK) (H) [well, 
MICHAEL: [I don't  see how it's] -- 
JIM: yeah, 
except it's] not, 
it's not uh, 
it's not so, 
 it's not squa=red, 
and it's not as predictable as that. 
I mean it's uh, 
(H) it's, 
 it's not predictable at all really. 
 It's=, 
 it's a it's a found pheno[menon]. 

MICHAEL: [(H)] Well it's not predictable if you apply random  values to the . subdivisions. 
JIM:  The subdivisions have to be random. 
 They ha- -- 
it has to  have .. randomness to it. 
(H) the order, 
I don't think is, 
 is understood. 
 yet. 
 I mean I might be wrong, 
but that's my understanding. 
MICHAEL: Hm. 
 (TSK) (H) . well, 
I th=ink, 
JIM: <SMOKING that's why, 
 they're calling it, 
 the equ- -- 
they're calling it, 
 uh, 
(H) the mathematics of chaos SMOKING>. 
MICHAEL: Oh, 
that's a different thing. 
That's not fractals (Hx). 
JIM: Yeah, 
that's fractals. 
 (H) <SMOKING It includes [other -- 
MICHAEL: [well fractals can be used] to describe [2chaos2]. 
JIM:  it includes], 
[2it includes SMOKING>2] other, 
 it i- -- 
Yes. 
It can. 
And it includes [other mathematics too]. 
MICHAEL: [But fractals is separate]. 
<X yeah X>. 
 I mean, 
and chaos is se- -- 
% they overlap. 
JIM:  Mhm. 
MICHAEL: (H)  Chaos <X I guess X> [is basically analysis] of noise. 
JIM: [For- for the scientist], 
 For the scientist, 
the scientist has never hav- -- 
has never had a tool, 
where he had that overlap. 
 you see. 
(H) 
MICHAEL: Hm. 
JIM:  see that's w- -- 
 that's the point that I'm trying to get at. 
is is that, 
(H) because the scientific method now has that tool of overlap, 
it's giving them something that they never had before. 
MICHAEL:  Hm. 
JIM:  a=nd, 
 tha=t is an opportunity for-, 
 to meet spirituality. 
MICHAEL:  Yeah well, 
 there's u%- -- 
JIM:  [in physics]. 
MICHAEL: [@ There's oppor]tunities to meet spirituality, 
 twenty-four hours a day wherever you go. 
(H) just by being alive. 
(H) If they don't wanna see it, 
they're not gonna see it in fractals. 
JIM: Well yeah, 
a lot of people will. 
A lot of people will uh, 
it'll dawn on them,

 They'll probably find it in something,

this is] Doctor [2~Naretto at the ~Kingman Vet Service2]? 
KRISTEN: [2X X X X X X X 2]. 
LINDSEY: I saw Tad [3this3] morning. 
MARCIA: [3yeah3]. 
LINDSEY: (H) Um=, 
He's looking not too ba=d, 
Um=, 
 A little bit of pain in his abdomen. 
It's hard to know if he just has, 
a gastritis=, 
 or gastroenteritis, 
from chewing on that dead pigeon, 
(H) or what the  problem is. 
(H) Um, 
what we ended up doing was, 
giving him some antibiotics=, 
 and sending him home=, 
 um, 
If he does not improve, 
we may need to take some X-rays, 
and he's got some bone=s, 
 or something in there. 
(H) (SNIFF) I didn't feel anything in his belly, 
but, 
 (TSK) yeah. 
(H) A lot of times if they get into garbage or dead things, 
 (H) they'll just get an upset stomach, 
 and, 
um, 
also a little bit of uh, 
 % well, 
just inflamation in-  in there. 
(H) and and just feel bad. 
(H) So, 
um, 
 I, 
 You know, 
Since he's not vomiting now, 
you can go ahead and feed him and stuff, 
and see=, 
 how he does, 
(H) Um, 
hopefully the antibiotics will calm down any  any infection, 
 that he, 
h- that he might have gotten from all the bacteria on the dead pigeon. 
(H)= um, 
(TSK) but if he, 
if he doesn't get better=, 
 or if he gets worse=, 
 be sure and let us know=. 
 (TSK) (H) well, 
but- -- 
Already by tomorrow, 
he should be feeling a lot better. 
 Um, 
and if he, 
if he isn't, 
or if he starts vomiting, 
or having diarrhea, 
(H) we may need to see him. 
we -- 
we w- will need to see him again. 
 so. 
(H) um, 
Okay=? 
 Mhm, 
you're welcome, 
mm bye. 
MARCIA:  Sh- uh, 
what did you, 
 what on your sheet, 
 what was the cost for the cast that you charged about, 
 what do we gen[erally]. 
LINDSEY: [I] think it was like fifty. 
LINDSEY:  [With] the cast, 
MARCIA: [Oh]. 
LINDSEY: to put it on. 
MARCIA: To actually put the cast on. 
LINDSEY: Casting materials and then, 
MARCIA:  Okay. 
LINDSEY:  And then um, 
 She had -- 
 pretty much when we rechecked her, 
she was ready to take it off. 
So we didn't have to do any  more X-rays or anything. 
MARCIA: Okay. 
LINDSEY:  I'm trying to remember, 
I think, 
 like, 
 with the [<X white X>], 
MARCIA: [<X You got X>] -- 
I thought you X-rayed it. 
 You X-rayed it with the cast on. 
LINDSEY: Yeah. 
[Mhm.] 
MARCIA: [XX] 
Yeah. 
LINDSEY: yeah, 
 yeah. 
 and it was ready to come off, 
and we took it off. 
 She did a real good job of [<X keeping it X>] -- 
>ENV: [((DOOR_CLOSE))] 
LINDSEY:  keeping it clean, 
and  dry. 
 That's, 
 I think, 
 half the battle. 
cause, 
(H)  she didn't have any sores, 
or anything, 
when we took it off. 
MARCIA: Mm yeah. 
(H) ~Kristen, 
for the, 
 for the tranquilizer what do we, 
what [is it] again. 
KRISTEN: [(TSK) ten]. 
MARCIA: Ten. 
(H)= [(Hx)= I wonder if] she would need more. 
KRISTEN: [and it'll be=] -- 
 Oh he'll, 
yeah. 
For [a casting]. 
MARCIA: [to do a cast]. 
 [2X XX Biotal2]. 
KRISTEN: [2<X if you just X>2], 
biotal and, 
 [Metofane]. 
MARCIA: [XXX] 
KRISTEN:  We [2just, 
MARCIA: [2or even2] -- 
KRISTEN: we'll put2] him on the machine. 
 And then you don't have to worry about em. 
MARCIA:  (H) What was, 
 what [would that] -- 
KRISTEN: [that would] be thirteen. 
MARCIA:  Total? 
or, 
 [thirteen extra]. 
KRISTEN: [No. 
plus thir]teen, 
for anesthesia. 
to put this  cast on. 
 Cause if you don't, 
then y- -- 
they're waking up, 
and you just, 
MARCIA:  It's [ba=d]. 
KRISTEN: [end up spend]ing more time, 
than if you just put em on the silly machine. 
MARCIA: O[kay]. 
LINDSEY: [Yep]. 
 As we know from the sheep. 
KRISTEN:  Well, 
and from other things too. 
 Just -- 
MARCIA:  [(TSK) Yeah]. 
KRISTEN: [Are those good]? 
 Do you like em? 
LINDSEY: Yeah. 
 Did you make em? 
KRISTEN:  I made em. 
 Yeah. 
 ah -- 
I was thinking they were more like a, 
(H)  chocolate chip cookie bar. 
 And then as I got through the recipe, 
I noticed that they don't [have any] flour in em. 
MARCIA: [@@] 
LINDSEY: @@@ 
 They're [good]. 
KRISTEN: [So] they're actually more like granola bars [2than2] & 
LINDSEY: [2They must have2] -- 
Yeah. 
KRISTEN: & cookie bars. 
LINDSEY:  [Yeah]. 
KRISTEN: [They've got] brown sugar and butter, 
 [2and2] & 
LINDSEY: [2Tastes2] like they have [3peanut butter3]. 
KRISTEN: & [3oatmeal3], 
 and peanut butter chips. 
 chocolate chips. 
MARCIA:  Okay, 
so a recheck would be about that much, 
with the  (H) & 
LINDSEY: Mhm, 
MARCIA: & X-rays, 
and then (Hx), 
 <WH X X WH> 
 Does that sound right? 
thirty-two, 
I= think, 
0f we -- 
 she woke up, 
we could  w- send her home tonight, 
 I wouldn't see why we couldn't send her home tonight, 
would you? 
LINDSEY: If she wakes up, 
 fine. 
MARCIA:  Oh well, 
we're [gonna be Biotaling her and oh, 
KRISTEN: [Sh- if sh- -- 
she probably won't, 
though]. 
MARCIA: never mind]. 
Never mind (Hx). 
I was thinking, 
I'm still thinking, 
(Hx) [@@] -- 
KRISTEN: [Na]. 
MARCIA: (H) 
KRISTEN: Na na, 
 na na na, 
 And she won't have any an- % antibiotics, 
Cause using all [X] X, 
MARCIA: [No]. 
KRISTEN: And that, 
MARCIA:  Thirty-two, 
KRISTEN:  What is this? 
MARCIA: Ten, 
for anesthesia. 
KRISTEN: Oh. 
MARCIA: But, 
KRISTEN: [they're still  opposite]. 
MARCIA: [they're opposite]. 
 (H) (COUGH) 
KRISTEN:  Yeah, 
 That looks all right. 
MARCIA: (H)  (Hx) 
KRISTEN: Don't you think we should charge them an extra eightee=n? 
MARCIA:  @@@ For the distemper [vaccine]? 
KRISTEN: [~Trent does it]? 
MARCIA:  No? 
KRISTEN: I felt horrible doing that on that  eye dog, 
that he  had in here last week, 
under whatever night it was. 
 Cause he had down. 
 twenty-five plus eighteen, 
and what can you do, 
when he's already got it down. 
MARCIA: <WH jeez WH>. 
(H) % (Hx) 
MARCIA:  (H) Well (Hx), 
 (H)  Well, 
all we did -- 
I can't do that, 
cause all we did was, 
 I was in [here] and put a bandage on [2(Hx)2]. 
LINDSEY: [Yeah]. 
[2Yeah2]. 
MARCIA: @@@ 
KRISTEN: Um, 
did you get hold of #Dan?

MARCIA: X 
TRENT: Three=, 
LINDSEY: [Sent home with] Amoxi, 
TRENT: [X <X fifty-three X>], 
LINDSEY:  and Pred, 
 So, 
 [We'll se how] -- 
KRISTEN: [Yeah. 
Well], 
I'll call him probably late this afternoon, 
to make sure he's  all right. 
>ENV: ((PHONE_RINGS)) 
MARCIA:  X 
 XX X X 
KRISTEN:  XX there? 
MARCIA:  (H) No, 
I was just trying to (Hx) figure out @what we spent already. 
LINDSEY: Mm. 
 Mm. 
MARCIA: Let' see, 
XXXXXX 
 We've already spent fifty for him, 
and I <X want him X> to spend another hundred. 
LINDSEY:  Well, 
MARCIA: But that's better than pins, 
LINDSEY:  [Right, 
MARCIA: [And surgery]. 
LINDSEY: Which would] be another, 
 two hundred or, 
KRISTEN:  Yeah. 
It's more [for a surgery]. 
MARCIA: [to spend]. 
LINDSEY:  Any -- 
pretty much [any time you can] -- 
MARCIA: [And that one] really, 
 you know, 
I don't think it would benefit from pins, 
LINDSEY: [M-m]. 
MARCIA: [because], 
we'd have to undo it. 
I mean we'd have to, 
(H) Well, 
we'd have to go, 
 we could -- 
we could try it closed, 
LINDSEY:  Mhm. 
MARCIA:  But, 
 still, 
it's more  expensive. 
LINDSEY:  I think it'll do fine with a cast. 
especially since it's a spiral fracture. 
MARCIA:  And it's not displaced. 
LINDSEY: And it's not displaced. 
 should be pretty stable. 
 It'll be kind of a pain getting the -- 
 well, 
 maybe not, 
getting the cast over the stifle? 
 Maybe not. 
MARCIA:  Well, 
[as long as she's] -- 
LINDSEY: [Got kinda long legs], 
MARCIA: As long as she's quiet. 
 Okay? 
 I'll give him a call. 
I don't know if he's in the barn, 
 from home. 
 In back in from the barn yet or not. 
HEIDI:  [XXXXXXXX]. 
MARCIA: [(H) Well, 
(THROAT)] 
HEIDI:  X called both the house number, 
and the barn number,

MARCIA: (H) (COUGH) 
MARCIA:  Yeah #Carol? 
 It's ~Marcia. 
 Hi=. 
(H) um=, 
we got X-rays done already, 
 and, 
 I was gonna let you know what, 
 what was going on. 
 Should I talk to #Richard? 
or  you okay. 
 Okay. 
(H) Um=, 
It looks like  she's got .. a spiral fracture, 
(H) Of um, 
 (TSK) of her tibia, 
which is the bone between the knee  and the hock, 
 (H) a=nd, 
 u=m, 
It's f- -- 
it's really looks, 
 pretty stable. 
It's not displaced very far % anyway, 
(H) and it's, 
um, 
 pretty much, 
 you know, 
locked in place, 
so to speak, 
(H) um, 
so I think, 
that she would, 
 she would do fine with a cast. 
 (H) U=m, 
 (H) a=nd, 
I pretty much got an estimate, 
so far=, 
 with the=, 
 
and the X-rays and everything, 
(H)  the bill was about fifty-four. 
 (H) And, 
to do a cast, 
 um=, 
(H)  with the anasthesia, 
and staying one more night in the hospital and stuff, 
and then the casting material, 
(H)  probably the -- 
% It's gonna be about a hundred and fifty-three, 
total. 
 (TSK) (H) A=nd, 
the only, 
then it would be=, 
 the only extra would be, 
(H) in about six  to eight weeks, 
we'd have her come in again, 
(H) we would tranquilize her, 
and take the X-rays, 
and see if it's  h=ealed. 
 Enough to take off. 
 (H) And that's generally about thirty-four to .. forty, 
somewhere in there. 
 Yeah. 
 You know, 
a pin, 
you know, 
if we did a pin, 
it's probably, 
it would probably be even  a hundred more. 
but, 
so it's, 
(H) it's, 
That's about the -- 
 at this point the, 
 the least expensive alternative, 
that probably will work, 
 for her. 
 (H) Um, 
 So, 
If you want to let him know and then, 
 have him call me back, 
 [if you], 
KRISTEN: [~Lindsey]? 
MARCIA: If you wanna go ahead and do it. 
 (TSK) Okay? 
KRISTEN: You wanna put this kitty castration [down]? 
LINDSEY: [Sure]. 
KRISTEN: XXX 
MARCIA: Alright. 
 (H) And if she -- 
you know, 
if we did it, 
she could probably go home tomorrow. 
 (TSK) 
 Okay, 
 whenever, 
whenever you get a chance. 
 Okay, 
thanks #Carol.

see, 
he's not only (H) the possessor, 
(H) he's also the one  who is possessed. 
 We possess him. 
 (H) He dwells in our hearts. 
(H) Uh, 
we have not only the gifts of the Spirit, 
in the plural, 
(H) but we have the gift of the Spirit 
 We have the Holy Spirit himself, 
given to us. 
 The promise of the Father. 
 (H) Uh they- the disciples were to wait, 
 until that great promise was given, 
the gift of the Holy Spirit. 
 (H) And so .. the Holy Spirit given to us, 
(H) uh f- -- 
works in us. 
Uh, 
 (H) that  sense of the presence of God's love. 
(H) And that's why uh Paul says, 
in Romans five, 
 that God (H) pours out his love in our hearts. 
 (H) By the Holy Spirit. 
 (H) Now, 
% there, 
the love that's poured out, 
 does not describe (H) the love that we have for Go=d, 
although that is the fruit of the Spirit you know, 
 love joy peace .. so on? 
(H) Uh, 
but 0n that passage, 
in Romans five, 
Paul isn't talking about (H) uh, 
the gift of love that we have for God, 
(H) he's talking about the gift of love that God has for us. 
 (H) Because he goes on to describe that love of God. 
 God commends his love toward us, 
in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us. 
 (H) So it's God's love for us, 
that's poured out in our hearts, 
by the Holy Spirit given to us. 
 (H) % Which is uh, 
 (TSK) (H) again. 
 (TSK) (H) uh, 
 a wonderful .. reality. 
 (TSK)  (H) Because, 
 if God didn't do that, 
 uh, 
<@ we wouldn't have a love for God @>. 
 There's no  spring of that divine love within us. 
 (H) It comes from him. 
 And it does come from him, 
and he does give it. 
 (H)= .. And so the Spirit is the spirit of (Hx) uh adoption. 
The spirit of sonship. 
 (H) Now, 
to be the spirit of sonship, 
he has to be also the spirit of fatherhood, 
right? 
(Hx) (H)  (H) Uh to make us <<POUND a+ware POUND>>, 
that we are children of God, 
(H) uh we have to know, 
 that he is our father. 
And so, 
(H) it is the love of God, 
made real to our hearts, 
 the knowledge that he does love us, 
 that he is present with us, 
(H) that uh  becomes of course then the source, 
(H) of our  uh .. love toward him. 
 (H) Um, 
 (TSK) (H) uh [friends], 
AUD: [(COUGH)] 
JEFF: uh, 
 (H) there's -- 
 there's nothing more important. 
 For the whole balance, 
and stability, 
and progress, 
and growth, 
of our Christian lives. 
 (H) Than, 
 % to realize, 
again, 
and again, 
and again, 
(H) the uh, 
 the wonder, 
 of our union with Jesus Christ. 
 Through the Spirit. 
 Because it's in Jesus Christ that we are united to the Father, 
 (H) and it is by the Spirit that Christ is present in our hearts, 
(H) and it's by the Spirit that the Father is present in our hearts. 
(H)  Two aspects .. of union with Christ, 
i- I think you all know this theology, 
but it always pays <X to X>  think about it again. 
 (H) The representative union, 
 the vital union. 
 (H) The representative union. 
 (H) The basis of our salvation. 
 (H) When Christ died, 
 we died (Hx). 
 (H) Because he died for us. 
 He died as our representative, 
he died in our place, 
 (H) uh he died as uh, 
(H) uh the one, 
(H) uh % who bore our sins. 
 In his own body, 
(H) on the tree. 
 So he was our representative. 
 Right? 
 (H) And he represented us, 
not only as Paul teaches, 
 not only when he died for us, 
but when he rose for us. 
 (H) And then he ascended, 
into the heavenly places, 
and where he is, 
we are. 
 (H) And that's why Paul says in Ephesians, 
that we are in the heavenly places, 
in Christ Jesus. 
 Why. 
(H) Representatively. 
 Where he is, 
 we are. 
 (H) Now, 
 that's a tremendously, 
 important of course, 
foundational, 
life-transforming truth. 
 (H) It's happened (Hx). 
 See (Hx), 
(H) you a=re a a new creature in Christ, 
because you're united to him. 
 (H) You ha=ve triumphed over sin and death. 
(H) You ha=ve died to sin. 
(H) And Paul's  reasoning about how we ought to live, 
[is] always grounded in that. 
AUD: [(COUGH)] 
JEFF: (H) Uh you know, 
in Colossians. 
Uh, 
(H) it's because, 
(H) Christ rose, 
 that we are to seek the things which are above. 
 .. You are risen with Christ. 
Seek the things which are above. 
 (H) Because you died with Christ, 
therefore mortify  sin in your members. 
(H) Put to death sin, 
because it has died. 
(H) In other words, 
the imperative is always grounded in the indicative. 
 Because of what Christ did for us, 
 therefore, 
(H) uh we live out of the fact, 
the reality, 
the accomplishment, 
(H) of his perfect work. 
(H) And don't forget, 
 Jesus not only paid the price of your sins, 
(H) but remember that he lived a perfect life for you (hx). 
(H) That the white robe of righteousness, 
that you wear in that last day, 
is the robe of Christ's righteousness. 
So, 
(H) it's all that Christ <MRC did for you MRC>. 
%= (H) uh % Jesus was baptized for you (Hx). 
(H) Uh let it be done to fill all righteousness. 
 The righteousness he had to fill for you. 
 See he he did it all for you. 
(H)= But then of course the other side of it is, 
it's not only representative, 
it's also vital. 
 Jesus Christ is the vine, 
(H) and we are the branches. 
Y- we're united to him. 
Our life is drawn from Christ. 
There is the uh, 
(H) uh not only the (H) the the legal uh aspect of that which Christ did for us,

 (H) Night and day among the tombs and in the hills, 
(H) he would cry out and cut himself, 
(H) with stones. 
 When he saw Jesus from a distance, 
(H) He ran and fell on his knees in front of him.

 (H) <F What do you want with me Jesus F>. 
(H) Son of the Most High God. 
 (H) <F Swear to God that you won't torture me F>.

 Then Jesus asked him, 
(H) What is your name. 
 (H) <Q My name is le=g=ion Q>, 
(H) he replied, 
(H) <Q for we are many Q>.

aa (H) The herd about two thousand in number, 
(H) rushed down the steep bank into the lake, 
 and were drowned. 
 Those tending the pigs ran off, 
(H) and reported this in the town, 
(H) and countryside. 
(H) And the people went out to see what had happened. 
 (H) When they came to Jesus, 
(H) They saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons. 
(H) Sitting there,

the sequence can't be too bad, 
I mean all [he did],

RANDY: Yeah. 
 All he did is send em all out. 
I mean [you got all the] West Coasts in the row over on charley,

RANDY: you got the jets in a row on bravo,

(H) So, 
 you can pick and choose.

[that's], 
LANCE: [Yeah]. 
RANDY: that, 
it works great.

RANDY:  (YAWN) <YWN So that was about all YWN>. 
 that I -- 
 you know, 
that I had.

I was paying pretty close attention there,

[Thanks]. 
RANDY: [N=o] significant problems.

 to talk about.

RANDY: [See there] was, 
 S- -- 
 (H) Oh um, 
 don't always,

 seven hundred. 
If you say --

you didn't need to say it when, 
 when you did.

 Well I mean [y- w- --

he was a-2] -- 
RANDY:  just go ahead and say, 
turn left heading one six zero. 
 [Okay]. 
RANDY: [Or turn] left heading two six zero. 
For a Metro. 
I mean if you leave em on runway heading, 
(H) for a little bit, 
LANCE: Mhm. 
RANDY: they're gonna be at the altitude you need so, 
 but that's no big deal. 
 A=nd uh, 
I was watching Jet Speed come in, 
 and you got Delta out in front of Jet Speed. 
LANCE:  Mhm. 
RANDY:  It seemed like you were a little tense with that but, 
(H) really pay attention to the speeds when they're coming in. 
He was doing a hundred and twenty outside of Laker there. 
 Did you see that? 
LANCE: Yeah. 
RANDY:  Yeah. 
LANCE:  So that -- 
 [that worked out great]. 
RANDY: [I wondered if you'd saw-] -- 
Yeah. 
I mean there was lots of room. 
 Lots of [time. 
LANCE: [Mhm]. 
RANDY: He] wasn't, 
he z- wasn't flying as a normal, 
LANCE: Mhm. 
RANDY:  For some reason, 
he just used the -- 
LANCE: Mhm. 
RANDY: Or is it uh, 
Exec Jet. 
 One of those guys is usually really fast. 
LANCE:  (H) Jet Speed [is th- I know fast on the] pr- departure, 
RANDY: [AM-Flight]. 
LANCE: it seems. 
RANDY:  Yeah. 
LANCE:  % I think. 
 It .. seems like that was the one, 
but, 
yeah AM-Flight, 
when they fly the later jet. 
(H) Um, 
yeah. 
And I think I might have said for delta niners or to, 
no delay, 
or some[thing like that and], 
RANDY: [Yeah. 
I think you did]. 
LANCE: @@@ 
 And he was actually floating at --

 yeah. 
RANDY: Yeah, 
you had a lot of time. 
LANCE: Yeah. 
RANDY:  When the Twins . get airborne, 
you got a jet <X following X>, 
the twin- twin's gonna go southwestbound? 
 (H) If you got six-thousand feet,

 you can start your transmission, 
then to the, 
 to the jet. 
LANCE:  Okay. 
RANDY: <Q Twin Cesna ahead is=,

RANDY: The Caravan's coming across, 
 if you wanna get (Hx) -- 
LANCE: (H) Yeah what do you say. 
Cause I've heard different phraseology, 
and I af-  feel like I was stumbling over that, 
I think I said it-, 
 couple different ways. 
RANDY:  A mile west, 
or something -- 
I'll- I just say, 
(H)  %= you know on a day like this, 
it's so easy to see em, 
I would just say the Caravan ahead, 
 is southwestbound. 
 <Q Runway two eight left,

 a lot of times they'll say uh in sight. 
 If they don't say in sight, 
 they'll say, 
 %= they'll (Hx), 
I would assume they have em in sight, 
because they won't go. 
LANCE:  Mhm. 
RANDY: Unless they seem em. 
I mean that's important to them, 
to see the traffic. 
 but it's safe, 
it's a safe operation. 
(H) Because, 
 0ne thing, 
(Hx) you could do, 
is is turn the  Caravan to two-forty. 
(H) 
LANCE:  Mhm. 
RANDY: To get him across. 
And then, 
 just before you ship em, 
send em back to two-fifty XX something like that. 
LANCE:  Hm. 
@@@ 
RANDY: (SNIFF) 
 Cause the track's what im-  what's important. 
 But, 
 but two-fifty was working out fine today. 
 Fifteen degrees and a mile. 
 Is what you need so, 
 or less. 
 using visual. 
LANCE:  Yeah, 
In fact it was a, 
 Was the West Coast that - 
 was it the Horizon who said he could  do the visual with the Twin Cesna ahead,

one of the two.

EVELYN: Another thing I thought was interesting,

she was tremendously,

EVELYN:  (H) You know, 
a funny -- 
there are two young people that I have talked to about the movie,

(H) one of them,

[I think] Margaret -- 
X: [XX]. 
EVELYN: and then she went on, 
to explain, 
she said, 
(H) maybe she was too stro=ng. 
 Uh, 
we're used to seeing someone as the= uh,

the protagonist,

the woman on the screen,

I've never played hearts be[fore, 
JENNIFER: [(H) You've never] played Hearts?

I don't know how to play it. 
JENNIFER:  Oh.

I'll teach you.

[That's you]. 
JENNIFER: [Queen of sp-] -- 
DAN:  (Hx) 
JENNIFER:  0.000000irst lead [rotates]. 
DAN: [(H)] 
JENNIFER: First, 
yeah. 
DAN:  (Hx) 
JENNIFER:  Always pass left. 
DAN:  (THROAT) 
JENNIFER:  Alright. 
 (TSK) (H) So this is us[=. 
DAN: [<@ Groucho, 
Harpo @>], 
JENNIFER:  % The object, 
okay, 
every] heart, 
 okay, 
every heart is one [point, 
DAN: [Is tr-] -- 
JENNIFER: the q-] queen of spades is thirteen points, 
the object is not to have any points. 
 And, 
(H) you p=lay following suit, 
 an=d, 
 you can take, 
if you take tricks, 
th- the highest card of the suit, 
takes the trick. 
If you don't have the card of the suit, 
[you throw] (H) whatever you want. 
DAN: [(H)] 
Okay. 
So h- hearts, 
 and the queen of spades, 
JENNIFER: Are [bad]. 
DAN: [are the] only thing. 
JENNIFER: That are -- 
DAN: That -- 
[that have points]. 
JENNIFER: [That are points]. 
Right. 
[(H) So if you- -- 
DAN: (H)  So], 
JENNIFER: if you throw] -- 
% 
[Look okay)]. 
DAN: [y-] -- 
JENNIFER: (H) 
DAN: so we got like three points, 
right here. 
 [Right]. 
JENNIFER: [we] have three points in our hand, 
[2exactly2]. 
DAN: [2And we w- wanna2] try to get [3rid of that3]. 
JENNIFER: [3(H) N_Right3], 
but we're pa=ssing. 
Now the first thing you do is you pa=ss three cards to your left. 
(H) Now these are low hearts. 
So I can -- 
 I'm not gonna pass those. 
I'm gonna pass, 
 the f- [ four of] clubs, 
DAN: [All the -- 
y- right-] -- 
 Why is that. 
JENNIFER:  And these are two high -- 
why -- 
just because. 
(H) And -- 
cause you should always pass a club, 
 so that the person -- 
(H)  so that the first hand, 
%y-  everyone has a club, 
so that they can't  discard a heart. 
Cause you always assume that everyone's t- -- 
no one is voi=d, 
of a suit. 
(H) The first time around, 
so you don't have to worry about throwing a high [card. 
DAN: [Yeah. 
 Yeah]. 
JENNIFER: (H)] And then I'm gonna throw two high cards, 
so I don't take those tricks. 
(H) [Because (Hx)] -- 
DAN: [(H) But what] difference does it make if you take a [2trick. 
JENNIFER: [2(H) Well because 0- -- 
DAN: They're not worth anything2]. 
JENNIFER: (H) Cause if I2]= t- -- 
If I take a tr- -- 
the k- diamond trick, 
(H) and somebody didn't have diamonds, 
and they threw a heart into that pile, 
I was gonna take that, 
with that ace. 
 So if I throw an ace of diamonds, 
and somebody doesn't have any diamonds, 
they're gonna throw a heart on me, 
and I'm [gonna have to] take that [2trick2]. 
DAN: [(TSK) (H)] 
[2Okay, 
but, 
but if they play hearts, 
that doesn't -- 
 that doesn't win anything. 
 [I- -- 
JENNIFER: [If they play h- -- 
DAN: n_okay. 
Just go ahead and play]. 
JENNIFER: Okay. 
Alright]? 
So I'm passing three s_three cards. 
(H) [And I got], 
DAN: [(Hx)] 
JENNIFER: the seven of hearts, 
three of hearts, 
and the king of f- spades. 
Begin play. 
(H) The two of clubs always leads, 
%  I'm gonna throw the ace of clubs, 
assuming I'm gonna take this [trick, 
DAN: [Okay- -- 
 Okay. 
JENNIFER: (H) no one <X have to X>] -- 
DAN: and then- -- 
and everybody] -- 
JENNIFER: Right. 
(H) 
DAN: So it's kinda risky playing the king, 
since, 
JENNIFER: But I'm gonna assume everyone [has clubs] still. 
DAN: [Okay]. 
Alright. 
[XXX] 
JENNIFER: [Okay, 
cause there are] thirteen cards, 
I'm assuming it's an equal deal. 
Now there are eight clubs out, 
(H) that means there are only f=our more left. 
DAN: So you don't -- 
y- -- 
 so you wanna play, 
JENNIFER:  [So I'm gonna-] -- 
DAN: [A high] d- -- 
high diamond. 
JENNIFER: (H)  Yeah, 
exactly. 
Like a high diamond (Hx). 
So jack of diamonds. 
 Okay, 
[taken with= -- 
DAN: [Okay, 
so he took that. 
JENNIFER: Okay. 
(H) Now the] spade, 
DAN: so now] -- 
JENNIFER: Now this is a tricky one, 
now, 
If I have a high spade now, 
I'd throw it, 
(H) because I could take this trick, 
and the h- my highest spade would be out. 
Now I don't ever wanna take the queen of spades, 
(H) high spades are dangerous because you might -- 
queen of spades is a hard cr- card to get [rid of]. 
DAN: [(H)] So if, 
 yeah okay, 
[I see]. 
JENNIFER: [Now I] don't have- -- 
oh I do have a [2spade2]. 
DAN: [2Well you're in a good2] position now, 
because you've seen what everybody else has played. 
JENNIFER:  Right. 
That's why. 
(H) [Diamond, 
DAN: [So you have to play a diamond. 
JENNIFER: (H) Now h-] -- 
DAN: Right]? 
JENNIFER: Right, 
and there have been no diamond- -- 
Has there been a diamond trick? 
[There's been one diamond trick. 
DAN: [uh=, 
y- -- 
 yeah. 
JENNIFER: w-] only one though. 
DAN: Yeah]. 
JENNIFER: Right? 
DAN: Yeah. 
JENNIFER:  Okay. 
DAN:  Yeah, 
you played your ace. 
JENNIFER: Okay now it was le=d, 
 the spade was led, 
 (H) but there's a heart in this trick. 
So I wanna get under the seven. 
JENNIFER:  Because I don't wanna take this trick. 
Because there's a heart. 
DAN: [Okay]. 
JENNIFER: [(H)] But that's easy, 
2[cause I2] only have two spades, 
DAN: [2(H)2] 
JENNIFER: and they're both under seven. 
DAN: %  so you would have taken that, 
JENNIFER: If I had [a eight]. 
DAN: [(H)] So now, 
[2you can2] still [3get under that, 
JENNIFER: [2(H)2] 
[3I could still get under so (Hx), 
Alright (Hx). 
DAN: too. 
 He's got an eight. 
So you-3] -- 
JENNIFER: [3(H) Now li3]sten, 
(H)  Okay now, 
b- two different people took  hearts. 
Now, 
if you t- have all -- 
if you take all the points, 
 if you take all the points. 
All thirteen hearts, 
and the [queen of diamonds, 
DAN: [So that's twenty-six points]. 
JENNIFER: (H) it's called], 
right. 
It's called shooting the moon, 
and you get -- 
 you give everyone else  twenty-six points, 
 or else you're minus twenty-six points. 
 And that's good. 
 Shooting the moon is really hard to do. 
(H) Now look it, 
I don't have a club, 
DAN:  So you can throw a heart. 
JENNIFER: there you [go]. 
DAN: [A high] heart. 
Okay. 
JENNIFER:  I don't have a club. 
 Now, 
 somebody else did take hearts. 
Right? 
 Or did he -- 
 or am I mistaken. 
 I thought ev- someone else did take hearts, 
I think somebody else did take hearts. 
(H) 
DAN: Queen of spades gonna have to come up m- -- 
[n-, 
JENNIFER: [There. 
DAN: there it is]. 
JENNIFER: He led, 
 0id] he just shoot the moon? 
 I thought someone else took -- 
 No. 
Ch- -- 
Yeah. 
So he got -- 
(H) Groucho got [one heart], 
DAN: [One], 
JENNIFER: and Chico got twenty-five. 
DAN: So he's b- [kinda bumming right now]. 
JENNIFER: [So he sucks]. 
right. 
DAN:  Okay. 
So pass three cards. 
So we [wanna]  pa=ss, 
JENNIFER: [%] 
 (H) Alright. 
Pa=ss, 
so we're gonna pass, 
the king of  spades. 
DAN: King of  puppy-dogs' feet. 
 @ . (H) How come you don't pass the king of .. clubs. 
JENNIFER:  (H) I might. 
 I don't have any aces here. 
 I'm gonna pass a low heart. 
 Just so they can't shoot the moon. 
(H) I got the ace of hearts, 
 Okay (Hx). 
 (H) Two of clubs. 
King of clubs. 
Ace is out. 
So my queen is the highest there. 
 Alright, 
my jack is the highest there. 
DAN:  So you wanna play that now. 
 Oh=, 
JENNIFER:  Well I'll do it. 
DAN:  [So you took] that one. 
JENNIFER: [Yeah]. 
DAN:  But that doesn't make any difference [%]. 
JENNIFER: [Right]. 
 Now the two -- 
 See, 
 alright. 
 Now. 
Diamonds are a- wasted. 
 Alright. 
DAN:  Did you just take that? 
JENNIFER:  No. 
DAN: That heart? 
[No]? 
JENNIFER: [No]. 
Groucho has the uh, 
DAN:  Spades were [led. 
JENNIFER: [The f=] -- 
DAN: So] you play, 
JENNIFER: Spa=de was led, 
[The ace]. 
DAN: [(H) Take- -- 
Can] you play a club, 
 if spades were led, 
and you [didn't have], 
JENNIFER: [I can] -- 
 %Yeah, 
[I can] -- 
DAN: [But], 
but if you had hearts? 
JENNIFER: [Yeah. 
DAN: [(H) So you can play anything then]. 
JENNIFER: I can lead -- 
I can pl- -- 
th- I can] play [2anything2]. 
DAN: [2So why don't you2] just get rid of high clubs. 
JENNIFER:  Right. 
I'm <X thinking I'm gonna know X> -- 
(H) who's -- 
G- Harpo's gonna take this, 
so the  points are split now. 
 So I don't have to worry. 
 (H) Now the queen is the highest, 
so, 
 % Two l- -- 
the two of hearts is a great lead. 
(H) You can't lead hearts, 
unless hearts have already been dropped, 
also. 
DAN: Yeah. 
JENNIFER:  (H)  Oh= shit. 
 <WH Oh fuck WH>. 
I took a point there. 
 I'm gonna take all= the rest,

 <WH Oh= man.

I'm gonna try to shoot the moon. 
#FOSTER: So Erasmus laid the the- -- 
laid the egg, 
which Luther hatched. 
 (TSK) And um, 
 when you come then, 
 to= (Hx), 
uh, 
however this debate. 
 This freedom of the will. 
(H) Um, 
 I think uh, 
let me read you a  page from Brendler. 
 Because it sets the sa- stage very nicely. 
This is in the Luther book some of you are reading, 
(H) and um, 
 if you, 
(H) this evening when you go home, 
if you wanna meditate it on more, 
(Hx) on- on it more, 
it's on page three eleven. 
 (TSK) (H) It's on page three eleven. 
 (H) But, 
let me just read you the-, 
cause this gives us the setting very nicely, 
and then  we can .. uh, 
 (H) <READ Erasmus entitled his anti-Luther pamphlet, 
 diatribe  concerning free will. 
 (TSK) (H) Once again, 
 the first  (H) and fundamental questions, 
disputed in fifteen sixteen, 
and fifteen seventeen, 
and again in Heidelberg, 
 in April of fifteen eighteen, 
(H)= with which Luther had opened the assault on scholastic theology, 
were debated. 
 Luther was glad to take up the the=me of this debate READ>. 
 (TSK) And this is what Luther writes to Erasmus. 
(H)  <READ You alo=ne. 
 Among all= the others, 
(H) have recogni=zed the key= question. 
(H) And you do not bore me. 
(H) With the Papacy, 
 purgatory, 
 indulgences, 
 and similar nonsense. 
(H) You, 
and you alone, 
have identifie=d that on which a=ll else hinges. 
(H) And you have put the razor to the throat. 
(H) And for that  I thank you heartily. 
 (H) U=m, 
 thus Luther evalu- uh evaluated the subject. 
And Erasmus commented on the significance (H) of their engagement, 
 in battle, 
 in his own style READ>. 
 (TSK) (H) And he wrote to Luther. 
<READ  (TSK) (H) Perhaps an Erasmus  who writes ... against you, 
(H) will do more for the Gospel, 
(H) than certain dunderheads  who support you READ>. 
 (H) And then, 
 <READ humanistic thinking, 
will never consent READ>, 
 this is Brendler now, 
obs- -- 
uh on this uh, 
but this sets the stage for what we're gonna  talk about, 
(H) <READ humanistic thinking will never conse=nt, 
to the doctrine of original sin READ>. 
 (TSK) Pico de la Mirandela would not have consented to the doctrine of original sin. 
 (H) (TSK) The author of uh, 
 what is it, 
Houseman I think, 

of Invictus. 
 <Q I am the master of my fate, 
(H) I am the captain of my soul Q>. 
(H) I don't think that he would (Hx)  acknowledge original sin. 
(H) <READ Is based READ> uh, 
alright, 
what is it, 
it's <READ based, 
as it is, 
on the concept, 
that human nature is totally depraved, 
(H) and of itself not capable of any good will. 
(H) (TSK) And that apart from grace alone, 
(H) free will is nothing, 
 can do nothing, 
 does nothing, 
(H) except depraved deeds. 
(H) Even though these pronouncements are Biblically based, 
 and may be acceptable within an exclusively theological system, 
(H) they do not appear  (SWALLOW) reconcilable with the dignity of man- -- 
dignity of man. 
(H) Catholic, 
 and semi-pelagianism, 
 (TSK) with all of it's emphasis on on the role of prevenient grace, 
(H) finally views, 
 free will, 
 as the decisive factor in attaining salvation. 
(H) Thereby conceptualizing free will, 
(H) as similar to a healthy  man- -- 
healthy human understanding, 
(H) for how can a person, 
(H) be responsible for his dee=ds, 
 if he possesses no free will READ>. 
 This is what Erasmus asked. 
 (H) (TSK) <READ How can he decide between good and evil. 
 So reasoned Erasmus. 
(H) Such arguments, 
 long known to Luther, 
 and many times  presented to him, 
 impressed him (H) not in the least. 
 (TSK) God alo=ne is salvation. 
(H) God alo=ne measures guilt. 
(H) He alone condemns. 
He alone grants grace. 
Justifies and saves. 
 When he will, 
 and whom he will. 
(H) Ma=n can do nothing against the divine prerogative. 
(H) Man can only accept the divine judgment. 
 (TSK) This is in fact best. 
(H) And if by -- 
(H) And -- 
 and it is by the divine prerogative, 
 that man .. will -- 
(H) uh=, 
that man is well provided for. 
 For God alone is infallible, 
 and his being is grace and mercy. 
 (TSK) This concept, 
(H)  that man is divinely elected to salvation, 
or to damnation, 

(H) is the center of the predestination dogma. 
 That later, 
 the Geneva reformer Calvin, 
(H) made the center of his teaching. 
(H) And that subsequently, 
under other historical preconditions and circumstances, 
(H) could be linked closely with a prosperous middle class, 
in the Netherlands, 
and in England READ>. 
(H)  U=m, 
 uh=, 
skip this paragraph, 
this is the paragraph though. 
Right here. 
The next one. 
(TSK) (H)  P- on page three twelve. 
When you, 
 when you read- -- 
if you wanna read it later. 
(H) <READ Therefore, 
 Luther did not accept rational arguments against predestination doctrine. 
(H) Such arguments, 
on the contrary, 
necessarily appeared to Luther, 
(H) given his theological orientation, 
(H) as suspicious. 
 From the very start. 
(H) Because they originated from human nature. 
(H) Which exalted itself against God. 
 (H) The who=re .. reason. 
(H) Prefers to submit to the Devil. 
(H) Adjusts to all situations. 
(H) And proves  everything, 
that is demanded of her. 
 Human nature, 
 <MRC does not .. possess .. free will MRC>. 
(H) It is like a horse. 
(H) Ridden by Go=d or the Devil. 
 The rider possesses the will. 
 The horse  obeys READ>. 
 (H) Well that's as clear as you can get it. 
 (TSK) Human nature is like a horse. 
 Ridden by Go=d or the Devil. 
 The rider possesses free will. 
 The horse= obeys. 
 Alright that, 
th_now the debate is joined you see. 
And as you come -- 
as Erasmus comes to this, 
he's going to say, 
(H) well let's look at the Scriptures. 
 (TSK) Now, 
 number one, 
we have to admit first- -- 
 v- first off, 
(H) that there see=m to be passages, 
there are passages in the Scriptures, 
 are there not? 
(H) (THROAT) Many. 
 Which see=m to teach, 
that ma=n is responsible for his deeds, 
and that he may act, 
and has a free will to respond to the invitation of God. 
(H) Isn't that clear in the Scriptures? 
(H) Whosoever wi=ll may come. 
 Um, 
 Jesus turned to his disciples, 
you remember, 
when some deserted him, 
and  seemed, 
because they were disappointed in  some of his sayings, 
(H) and they were offended by some of the things he said, 
(H)  and they walked no longer with him it said. 
 (TSK) And then he turned to those who remained, 
and he said, 
<Q Will ye also go away Q>? 
 They had a choice. 
Didn't they? 

 Will you go away. 
 What do you will. 
(H)  And the will, 
 apparently was, 
re- resided in  in these disciples. 
(H) And so Erasmus is going to say, 
so obviously, 
in Scripture we ha=ve  paradox. 
 We have clea=r passages of Scripture, 
(H) which seem to indicate that ma=n  <<POUND +has a +free will, 
 and that he can +exercise POUND>> that will, 
 to follow, 
or not to follow. 
(H) To respond or not to respond. 
(H) On the other hand, 
(H) we have passages of Scripture, 
(H) which  seem to indicate, 
 that the will is not free, 
 and that the-, 
and that man i- th- is- -- 
man is predestined  by a .. an omnipotent sovereign will of God. 
(H)  We have to take both these pass- -- 
So it's not a question of the Scriptural authority. 
 We both accept the scriptural authority. 
And Erasmus in his writings, 
and in his pamphlet the Liber Arbetrio, 
in his pamphlet the Liber Arbetrio, 
says to Luther, 
qu- because it is addressed to Luther you see, 
(H) he says to Luther, 
(H) uh, 
I will not church -- 
 I will not .. question, 
or I not -- 
I will not quote. 
I will not quote the Church Fathers to you, 
(H) because I understand you accept <@ no Church Father authority, 
(H) if it is in disagreement with your opinion @>. 
(H) So I will quote the only authority that you recognize, 
 The Holy Scriptures. 
 (TSK) And so, 
 uh, 
exclusively Erasmus will appeal to the Scriptures, 
as his basis. 
(H) When God created Adam and Eve in the garden, 
he placed them in the garden, 
and he said you have a choice. 
(H)= Uh=, 
you have a choice. 
Do not eat of the fruit of the knowledge of the good- -- 
of the tree of good and evil, 
for on the day ye eat thereof, 
ye shall surely die. 
 Now=, 
do not do that, 
 and obviously Go=d m=ust have given, 
the first (H) created pair, 
(H) a choice. 
Because the whole (H) system  of reward or punishment, 
 is based upon the decision which is .. these individuals made. 
Or=, 
(H) when Cai=n slew Abel. 
(H)= (TSK) U=m, 
 if you do we=ll? 
 Shall you not be s- sustained? 
But if you do evil? 
(H) Sin  crouches at the door. 
 If you do well. 
 Apparently, 
from this, 
 Cain  had the ability, 
 even after the mur- -- 
0.000000e+00ven after the murder of Abel, 
(H) he had the ab=ility, 
(H) to make a positive choice. 
 According to Erasmus. 
That's going to be his position. 
(H) Well Luther, 
 (TSK) um, 
 I'll g- I'll I'll tell- say some of the things that he he picked first, 
Erasmus picked first, 
(H) and um, 
 he's gonna go all through the Scriptures, 
and he's gonna take passages like this, 
(H) um, 
 (TSK) return return the prophets said, 
did they not to ancient Israel. 
Return to the God of the covenant, 
return (H) Hosea pleads with Gomer, 
 please come back .. t_you see. 
(H) And uh, 
this is the symbol of Israel, 
come back to the Lord, 
(H) come back to the= the husband of the covenant, 
come back to= the one who called you and summoned you, 
(H) it's the- -- 
Erasmus says the whole premise is, 
(H) that you have a- an ability, 
to return. 
That you can make up your mi=nd, 
(H) to change the course that you're now taking. 
(H) And that you can  go this way, 
 or you can go that way. 
(H) And uh, 
 then there are other arguments which are, 
(H) uh, 
 here's uh, 
here's one on um, 
I'll read an excerpt, 
 in this uh, 
in this little book, 
this is the um, 

 the actual uh, 
 wr- writings of the s- f-  freedom of the will, 
(H)  here's he .. he uses Ecclesiastes. 
 God, 
and this is a quote, 
(H) from the b- -- 
 from the book. 
(H) <READ God made man from the beginning, 
 (H) and left him in the hand of his own counsel. 
 (TSK) He added his commandments, 
 (H) and  precepts. 
 If thou would keep the commandments, 
 and perform acceptable .. fidelity forever, 
(H)  they shall .. preserve thee. 
 He hath set w- -- 
he hath set water and fire before thee. 
 Stretch forth thy hand, 
(H) to which thou wilt. 
(H)  Before man is life and death. 
 Good and evil. 
 That which he shall choose, 
(H) shall be given him READ>. 
 Choose. 
 (H) So Erasmus's argument is, 
 you have a right to choose. 
You can choose. 
(H) And therefore if you can choose, 
this presupposes  (TSK) that you have a free will. 
(H) In any rate, 
 if  man is, 
 uh, 
if there is a necessity in man's action. 
If he is pre=determined to sin. 
(H)  If .. if God has already determined, 
(H) that this person  commits these acts. 
(H) Then  there can be no responsibility on the part of the actor. 
(H) On the part of the perpetrator. 
Because how can a person be held responsible (H) for deeds, 
(H) which he does, 
 if he= 0mself did not will those, 
the- f- -- 
if, 
in other words, 
he may will those deeds, 
but those -- 
th- those deeds were imposed upon his will by a transcendent force. 
(H)= If that is the case, 
then there is really no freedom of the will. 
(H) And if uh=, 
in that case, 
therefore, 
a person cannot be responsible for his deeds, 
(H) if the deeds which he commits, 
have already been eternally foreordained. 
 (SNIFF) This is uh=, 
this is going to be then Erasmus's argument, 
ag- on this qu- on this question of the freedom of the will. 
(H) But uh=, 
 uh, 
(H)  we'll .. look at another couple p- uh of his passages. 
If, 
 here it is. 
<READ If the will  were not free, 
 (H) sin could not be attributed to man. 
 (TSK) It ceases to be sin. 
 If it is not voluntary. 
 (H) Free wi=ll is not extinct. 
 Though it has contracted a paralysis READ>. 
 (SNIFF) . (H) How is it paralyzed. 
Well it's paralyzed by the fall. 
 See we all=  participate in the Adamic nature. 
 (TSK) (H) A=nd this Adamic nature, 
 uh, 
when Adam=, 
 in Adam=, 
remember the New Eng-  New England primer, 
<Q in Adam's fall, 
we sinned all Q>. 
(SNIFF)= So=, 
this Adamic nature has been, 
 has been passed on to all generation=s of humans. 
(H) And so therefore while we -- 
(H) we have a free will, 
it is -- 
it is paralyzed. 
 It's not the will .. that was there. 
 (H) It's not the will, 
 that uh, 
 that Adam had. 
 Because  it no longer .. has the freedom .. that Adam had. 
It is cursed by sin. 
It is under the curse of sin. 
(H) So the human will, 
somehow, 
is paralyzed. 
(H)  Uh Erasmus admits that. 
(H) And then, 
Erasmus will say, 
that um, 
 (TSK) (H) God then enables. 
What God does, 
and this will be the C- really the modern Catholic view. 
(H) That God will provide a prevenient grace. 
 A prevenient grace. 
That is in other words, 
even though I am unwilling to accept the gift of salvation, 
you see, 
(H) that um, 
 that God will give me a prevenient grace, 
(H) which will  enable me, 
 to move toward .. this salvation. 
 (TSK) (H) And if I then respo=nd. 
 positively. 
(H)  To the gift of God, 
(H) then  God will extend .. the exemplary grace to me, 
 which enables me  to acquire salvation. 
(H) So prevenient grace, 
will put you on the path. 
(H)  If you respond on the path, 
(H) then God extends the exemplary grace, 
(H) which will lead you home. 
(H) He uses a little= story. 


 A little  uh .. uh .. allegory. 
 Or figure I guess. 
(H)  (TSK) Uh there uh there's a n- (Hx) -- 
 there's a tot, 
 a toddler. 
 (H)  (TSK) Uh, 
 but he's got to be %-  big enough to a=ppreciate apples. 
 Okay? 
@@ <@ Because, 
@@ his, 
(H) alright, 
@ because that's the, 
that's part of the story @>. 
(H) There a  nice .. shiny .. apple. 
 Over here. 
 (TSK) (H)  Over here, 
you see. 
 And this  little .. tot, 
 he sees the apple. 
(TSK) (H)  A=nd he uh=, 
 he needs, 
 he wants to get to this apple. 
 (H) U=m, 
 so he starts . in the direction of the apple. 
But he's very unsteady. 
He wavers. 
You see, 
and he's not, 
(H) so, 
what  is the prevenient grace. 
The prevenient grace is the adult, 
(H) which  doesn't .. take him .. to the apple, 
 doesn't lift him up and put him next to the apple, 
(H) b- but % . goes along with him, 
just guiding him, 
making sure that he  he doesn't fall, 
(H) he just, 
 he lets hi=m get there. 
(H)  But .. he just .. more or less, 
(H) supports or sustains the little tot, 
in his motion  toward the apple. 
(H) So the little tot you see, 

 (TSK) Has decided he wants the apple. 
Once he sees it, 
(H)  uh, 
then he=, 
he moves toward it. 
(H) Prevenient grace assists him  toward that apple. 
(H) It doesn't, 
 as I said, 

it doesn't carry him there, 
(H) it doesn't  go get the apple and bring it to him, 
(H) he must go to the apple. 
But he goes= sustained by this prevenient grace. 
And then, 
(H) if he, 
(H)  if he half way to the apple, 
if he decides he doesn't want it, 
 if he  if he sees something he th- considers more attractive, 
 and he goes off on a tangent, 
or goes off in a different direction, 
(H) then you see, 
 then his wi=ll has decided that he does not want to cooperate. 
 With prevenient grace. 
(H)= Luther hated that word cooperation. 
W- particularly in connection with grace. 
 (H) Now Luther's position is, 
 we are dead  in trespasses and sin. 
(H) You see. 
 There is (H) nothing (H) that can .. come to us, 
you see now Luther came to his reformation remember, 
(H) with this fear of the righteousness of God. 
(H)= The righteousness of God. 
And Luther all through his monastic life, 
up until around fifteen fifteen, 
is probably when he made that tower discovery. 
 (H) That so-called <L2 Turmerlebnis L2>. 
(H) The= tower experience. 
 (TSK) Where reading in Romans one seventeen, 
 he read, 
(H) you know, 
 (THROAT) . the j- the just .. shall live by faith, 
well, 
 you have to take rea- really read Romans one sixteen first. 
 (H) (TSK) U=m, 
 <READ I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 
 (H) .. For it is the power of God onto salvation. 
 To everyone that believeth, 
 (H) to the Jew first, 
 and also to the Greek. 
(H)= For therein READ>, 
 therein, 
it can only refer grammatically to Gospel, 
you see. 
(H) <READ I am not ashamed of the Gospel. 
(H) For therein. 
(H) Is the righteousness of Go=d revealed. 
 As it is written. 
 <MRC The just  shall live .. by faith MRC>READ>. 
 A=nd, 
when he discovered this, 
he had read this a hundred times. 
 But this one time when he read it, 
(H) he said, 
 suddenly it dawned on him. 
 What this meant. 
 <Q And this place in Pau=l Q>, 
Luther said, 
<Q Became for me, 
(H) the gate of paradise Q>. 
 <L2 Es ging mir ein Licht auf L2>. 
(H)  The light broke in on me. 
(H)  And what was this light. 
 (TSK) That the righteousness of God, 
 is passive righteousness. 
 It's not the righteousness, 
you see, 
Luther said, 
<Q I hated that  that phrase righteousness of God. 
(H) What does righteousness of God mean. 
(H) Righteousness of God means, 
(H) God is holy. 
(H) And I'm a sinner. 
 And I can never stand in his presence. 
(H) And the gulf between us can never be bridged, 
 and he's gonna c=ast me into Hell, 
because of my sin. 
(H) What shall I do to earn the righteousness of God Q>. 
So you see he was constantly (H) preoccupied with this thought, 
(H) of somehow, 

(H) satisfying the righteousness of God. 
(H) Through some work. 
 (H) Through some indulgence. 
(H) Through some prayer. 
S_through- through- through- renunciation. 
Through fasting. 
Through vigils. 
(H) You know, 
he says, 
if a monk, 
if a m- m- % -- 
(H) <Q if ever a monk could've gained heaven through his monkery, 
(H) it would have been I.

#FOSTER: (H) Because he d- he did everything, 
 that he thought would, 
 would make God respond .. sympathetically to him. 
And and pacify= this righteousness. 
(H) And he was always miserable. 
 (TSK) And then he discovered, 
(H) it's nothing that I do=. 
 It's what I accept in faith. 
 Namely, 
 the sacrifice of Christ, 
the vicarious sacrifice of Christ, 
for my sin on the cross, 
(H) I reach out, 
 I accept that, 
 %as my -- 
 and .. and then the righteousness of God, 
(H) is  imputed to me. 
 It's given to me. 
 The  <MRC the just (H) shall live .. by faith MRC>. 
 And so, 
(H) this life  in God comes to you not, 
 <ot, 
it's not God %>, 
th- this <L2 deus absconditus L2>, 
this concealed God, 

this angry God, 
this God who's waiting to throw you into Hell at any minute, 
(H)= that  that was the image that Luther had. 
And now you see, 
and and and works were associated with this. 
His works. 
What do I have to do, 
(H) what do I have to do to placate him. 
What do I have to do to please him. 
(H) And now you see the breakthrough comes. 
(H) So, 
(H) Luther, 
from his point of view, 
you see, 
he's coming at it from an angle of a  of an Augustinian monk. 
He's coming at it from that. 
With this travail of soul. 
This agony and anguish (H) of looking for this God. 
(H) So, 
(H) he is, 
 after this discovery, 

(H) he is going to  detest (H) anything .. in theology, 
(H) which smacks of (H) human effort, 
 or human work, 
 sufficient . to please God, 
 or to placate God. 
(H) N=o. 
 There is nothing you can do to please God. 
(H)  God .. loves you, 
 he gives you his grace, 
(H) totally (H) out of his grace, 
 and n=othing from your merit. 
 So the human will (H) cannot, 
 you cannot decide (H) to accept God, 
and his grace. 
 Even the gift of faith. 
It's interesting in um, 
 (TSK) in Bonifas, 
in his book= uh, 
now he's a French Huguenot. 
So you would expect it. 
(H) But it's still, 
it comes in an interesting scene. 
(H)  Where he's in one of the camps. 
It's in the second world war, 
he's in the concentration camp in Germany, 
 (TSK) and it's very, 
b- it's a beautifully written book. 
And and he=, 
uh, 
he's in this scene, 
(H) in this camp, 
 and, 
 you know, 
(H)  you just wanna give up, 
a(Hx)_I mean, 
(Hx)_every day is, 
(H) you're hanging onto life  by your  fingernails. 
(H) And u=m, 
 he said, 
 every day, 
we just lived for one day. 
We lived one day at a time. 
And then he said it dawned on me, 
(H) that um, 
 I I prayed, 
I lifted up my= voice to the Lord, 
we prayed together, 
and I prayed, 
and, 
(H) and he said then it came to me. 
 (H) That .. what sustains me in this situation, 
in this concentration camp, 
 (H) what sustains me, 
 is my=, 
 <MRC my d=eep f=aith  in God MRC>. 
<P  And then he said, 
 and then it dawned on me, 
 that this deep faith, 
which I have in God, 
 is not . my creation. 
 Well that's interesting, 
isn't it. 
 (H) This faith . was given me. 
 I did not create it, 
 I did not conjure it up, 
 it came to me. 
 It was given to me. 
 That's the testimony of a Huguenot. 
 (H) Inmate .. in a concentration camp P>. 
 (H) Well let's take a break. 
 
PATTY:  I Just wanted to go over the changes in the schedule? 
 (H) Um originally, 
 we were going to require the um, 
 request fo=r statement of interest and qualifications to come  back to, 
 uh, 
 twenty North Clark Street, 
on April seventh. 
 (H) Um, 
 but the, 
 um, 
 coordinating council felt that it was wise to give the community, 
 more time, 
 a weekend, 
 two days, 
 to uh= . augment .. whatever application [people were gonna] submit, 
AUD: [(THROAT)] 
PATTY: so the due date is changed from  April .. seventh, 
 to April eleventh, 
at noon. 
 And you can drop off those proposals at twenty North Clark Street. 
 (H) Um, 
the same  process  will continue, 
 but for the changes in the time, 
at the time that you  drop off your proposal, 
 you will be scheduled for a uh .. public .. meeting, 
 where you will be given a chance and an opportunity to present your (H) uh proposal. 
 (H) Um right now we're looking at April fifteenth, 
which is a Friday, 
and s- -- 
 and April sixteenth, 
 as the uh date for that public presentation, 
 and we don't know, 
 where that will be held, 
or what time that will be held, 
but we'll make sure that everyone gets noticed about that. 
 (H) During April seventeen to the twenty-third, 
the coordinating council will identify the empowerments on location, 
(H) a=nd uh=, 
 during the week of uh A[pril twen]ty-fifth, 
AUD: [(COUGH)] 
PATTY: there will be a city-wide meeting to present the selected empowerment zone,

a public presentation of,

(H) the place date and time  will be announced. 
(H) um, 
 and on June thirtieth, 
that's the drop dead date, 
 um, 
when we will send the application, 
 for selection by HUD as an empowerment zone for Chicago. 
 (H) Um, 
 is- if there are no other questions, 
um, 
we can, 
 yes sir. 
GRANT:  <X I have X> a question. 
PATTY: (TSK) Yeah. 
GRANT:  Worst case scenario. 
 After we submit em, 
 the- uh the proposal application, 
 uh, 
human beings being what they are, 
 organizations being what they are. 
 what  will the coordinating council, 
what does the city propose to do, 
 when there's a hue and cry. 
 from those who attempting . to empower themselves, 
 a=nd combined with coupled with those who are seeking more power. 
 Who= say= unfair, 
 this= . wasn't done right, 
 according to . our perspective, 
 or this that and the other. 
PATTY:  that [would be the] worst case scenar[2io2], 
GRANT: [X] -- 
[2worst2] case scenario. 
AUD: (COUGH) (COUGH) 
GRANT: What can  the city, 
what -- 
 what can the coordinating council, 
 or what's gonna be p- -- 
 be in place, 
 to= . listen to all the criticisms, 
AUD: (COUGH) 
GRANT:  all of the=  disappointments at, 
 not being selected, 
 so that, 
 let's say optimistically, 
 there are some good ideas. 
 s=ome oversight, 
or something that can be corrected, 
 hopefully that's . of minor proportion. 
 So that, 
 we can still keep the city, 
 running smoothly, 
 and becoming more and more beautiful. 
PATTY:  I don't know if that issue has been discussed by the um coordinating council? 
I think it's a legitimate issue, 
 u=m, 
 I w- y- would be willing to take that back, 
to have them discuss that, 
but, 
 I mean the worst thing would be for, 
 HUD not to recognize that this is a c- collaborative effort, 
a partnership, 
between the community, 
the city, 
the business community and the neighborhoods, 
(H) and, 
 I mean it wouldn't bode well, 
 for Chicago to get an empowerment zone if, 
 if everyone .. were not supportive and on board. 
 So, 
 I mean that answers your question. 
I don't know= what the coordinating council's role, 
 in that case would be. 
 But we'll  definitely take that message back. 
 <X on that [question I- X>] -- 
GRANT: [May I propose] that the coordinating council consider, 
 my  individual worst case scenario, 
 and any other worst case scenarios, 
that they  collectively <X might come up with X>. 
 Notwithstanding #Paul #XX's suggestion, 
 that the empowerment zone . moneys, 
a hundred million, 
 CTA green line, 
three-hundred million, 
 be utilized, 
 effectively and efficiently, 
 to get a bigger bang for the buck. 
PATTY:  kay XX, 
ROSE:  I just wanted to say that, 
 there's also some other opportunities for, 
 um, 
 organizations that are new,

 that hear your voice.

the COBCU,

 Small Business Development Center, 
I couldn't even begin to mention the list, 
because there's about twenty-five different assist and nonassist agencies on there. 
 But I think that, 
 anybody who belongs to an organization, 
 um, 
 that . has any type of .. connection with the city, 
 it would be good to --

 <X again X> I was trying to reframe his concerns in the best case scenario. 
The Alderman spoke to, 
 you feel that, 
somehow the process that has been established. 
 Um, 
 could divide the city. 
 Best case scenario would be the- %, 
 provisions were made, 
 such that the ideas that come out, 
and the collaborations that come out of this process, 
 and let them  continue. 
Whether or not the city of Chicago is designated for anything. 
 That- .. that some reassurance of what comes out of it, 
AUD: (THROAT)

um, 
somehow taken into consideration,

 from the city of Chicago, 
PATTY:  I think the city is -- 
 I mean I know the city is committed to that, 
and I know that that has come up at the= i- um, 
 (TSK) (H) the coordinating council meeting. 
A desi=re to work, 
 continue to work, 
AUD: (COUGH) 
PATTY:  with people, 
. no matter what happens, 
on this issue, 
and there's been some discussion about, 
(H) u=m, 
 other kinds of funds, 
that could be  put towards implementing, 
uh, 
 uh, 
 areas -- 
 plans in areas that are not selected, 
AUD: (THROAT) 
PATTY: um, 
so I think there is a commitment to do that, 
and that -- 
 that certainly has been the spirit, 
(H) of the um  coordinating council. 
 <X You, 
and then #Paul X>. 
DAN: Um, 
 I've got uh  three questions .. for you. 
Uh, 
 and I suppose your response is gonna just  kinda XX on there, 
but first, 
 um, 
 does the city have any idea how many uh, 
 requests they're gonna- -- 
how many proposals that they're gonna be getting? 
 Do you have [an estim]ation? 
PATTY: [No]. 
DAN:  So=, 
AUD: <X At least one X>. 
DAN: [@=@ 
MANY: [(LAUGHTER)] 
DAN: I'm sure. 
U=m], 
[2s-2] -- 
AUD: [2(THROAT)2] 
DAN:  Uh well that kind of leads into my- -- 
 my next question I think touches on .. these people's questions, 
as far as, 
(H) %  it seemed like it would behoove us all, 
if there were some kind of  consensus building process before, 
 uh, 
 <X this went on and X>, 
 So what people are saying, 
they're having community meetings, 
 community organiza- -- 
 % -- 
 community, 
uh, 
 group meetings. 
 But, 
 uh, 
 it's= -- 
 from what I understand of this empowerment zone  process, 
the idea is to really  involve [things on a g-] grassroots level. 
AUD: [(COUGH)] 
DAN:  A=nd, 
 my two concerns on par- -- 
as far as participation goes, 
 are o=ne, 
 that, 
 a- and I voiced this concern with <X elder #Jarret X> when, 
 uh last month at the, 
 uh, 
 Washington- -- 
or uh Washington Library Center when they, 
 uh, 
XX <X the person introduced X> that. 
 A=nd, 
 that is, 
 simply . throwing this out into the community and saying that, 
 you expect the community to be able to respond, 
 Community groups to be able to respond to you. 
(H) Is, 
 I think it- at l- at least, 
not an effective, 
 uh instrument for -- 
for getting this done. 
 Uh, 
AUD:  (COUGH) 
PATTY: I think [that that's the expecta]tion of the -- 
DAN: [It doesn't -- 
it doesn't address] -- 
PATTY: [2of the XXXX2]. 
DAN: [2% It doesn't address the fact2] that, 
 one, 
 community organizations, 
 (H) um, 
and many are-  of them being service providers, 
 do not necessarily ha=ve, 
 the same . goals? 
 in mind, 
as community residents do. 
They've got different agendas, 
they've got different  priorities, 
they've got different  purposes. 
 than, 
 members of the r- the community themselves. 
 (H) U=m, 
 the second thing is that, 
 people who do not live, 
 directly inside, 
(H) the areas that are gonna be part of the empowerment zo=nes, 
 they've got an overriding concern in this because, 
(H) as Mr. #Pollack said, 
A hundred million dollars is just gonna be a drop in the bucket. 
 To be able to make these things work, 
and especially to make them work over a ten year process, 
(H) that this is calling for, 
 there're gonna be a lot of community . resources, 
 s- -- 
 uh, 
 from the federal government, 
 from the state, 
 county, 
 and city, 
that are gonna need to be  marshalled, 
they're gonna need to be, 
 reallocated to this area. 
 And to be able to have a consensus, 
not just within  the empowerment zone, 
but within the city itself, 
if these services. 
 Are gonna be provided and maintained, 
 over the ten years, 
 through different administrations, 
 through different aldermen, 
 political processes, 
 involved, 
 these people are not being brought into the decision-making process beforehand. 
 And I think this speaks to these people's concern, 
(H) [that] -- 
PATTY: [These people] meaning who. 
 The -- 
DAN: I I heard several people, 
this  this r- -- 
 I don't know their names. 
So I'll just have to -- 
 woman in yellow, 
 gentleman here in the glasses, 
that, 
 there's gonna be 0h, 
 uh earlier that very first speaker, 
gentleman uh, 
#Ed #Smith. 
 Uh, 
 that you're gonna be receiving a number of . proposals, 
 and, 
 you say you don't know how many, 
I don't know how you're gonna have, 
 twenty-eight  thirty-two people that you said, 
on a coordinating council read, 
 maybe a hundred proposals, 
 within a week's time, 
 and be able to . arrive at one ... selected empowerment zone, 
 it seems to me that it-  be much more beneficial, 
 if the entire community as a whole, 
 was brought into this process, 
 and, 
 this is what I'm bringing up is, 
the idea of participation. 
 True community-based citizen participation. 
 would involve ongoing series of meeting, 
 that I would think that the . coordinating council would be ... promoting, 
 [would be organizing and directing on an] 0ngoing 0.000000e+00ven nightly basis, 
AUD: [(COUGH) (COUGH) (COUGH)] 
PATTY:  That's not [2exact2]ly grassroot  planning, 
DAN: [2to be2] -- 
PATTY: either. 
DAN: Right. 
PATTY: (H) um, 
 grassroot planning, 
is when people get out in the community, 
and organize, 
DAN:  But [they need a forum. 
PATTY: [and do the work]. 
DAN: they need] -- 
(H) if this woman here [2today did2] not speak [3up3], 
PATTY: [2a=nd2], 
PATTY: [3Let me3] answer your [4question. 
DAN: [4All these people here would not even know a meeting was going on4]. 
PATTY: Let me  try to respond to your ques4]tion sir. 
 So=, 
 % what you're suggesting is not a grassroot, 
in my opinion, 
a grassroot  process. 
(H) Secondly, 
the the the reality is, 
 we only have, 
 till June thirtieth to submit an application. 
 [A] really -- 
 a true strategic planning process, 
grassroot, 
 takes many more months than that. 
 Many [more years than] we have. 
DAN: [XX] 
PATTY:  Okay? 
(H) So, 
we have to do the best that we  can do, 
given the time that we have. 
DAN:  And all I'm saying is, 
I'm saying that, 
 I don't believe a forum, 
is being presented for community groups to -- 
 I mean, 
some people are finding out about this for the first time tonight, 
some people are finding out about meetings, 
that are going on with other groups, 
for the first time tonight, 
(H) this is not being promoted by the city, 
this is not being (H) publicized as a [forum  as a] -- 
PATTY: [It has been pro]moted, 
it has been publicized. 
[I don't know] -- 
DAN: [I'll tell you right now, 
that the] leading, 
(Hx) onprofit, 
 affordable housing provider on the West Side, 
isn't even involved with this. 
He said he hasn't even XXX -- 
PRIDE. 
 has not even been contacted, 
by those groups on the West Side. 
PATTY: Well, 
let me tell you. 
I've worked with PRIDE, 
 and I had a meeting with PRIDE last week, 
they know about it. 
DAN: I didn't say they didn't know about it, 
I said they're not being -- 
they're not being contacted by y- -- 
 as far as being brought into a network, 
 for this. 
I'm I'm sorry, 
I'm not trying to be confrontational. 
Okay, 
I'm trying to raise  issues and concerns. 
Alright? 
PATTY: Although [I do think, 
DAN: [The second -- 
my second qu-] -- 
PATTY: that the] organization, 
has a responsibility. 
 If they're [interested] in this, 
DAN: [Undoubtedly]. 
[2Undoubtedly2]. 
PATTY: [2And they care2] about empowerment of th- of their [3 constituency3], 
DAN: [3Undoubtedly3]. 
PATTY: to get involved in the process, 
and find a way to make that [happen XX]. 
DAN: [M- my second] question would be on the process, 
% the city obviously's got its own priorities, 
it's got, 
 u=m, 
 funds already allocated in budget, 
it's got areas designated that they would like to see worked on, 
 a=nd, 
 my question as far as the process is c- -- 
way the selection goes, 
 are um, 
 what -- 
w- which is gonna drive which. 
 How much weight are gonna be given to=, 
 u=m, 
 proposals, 
which  dovetail into .. existing programs, 
that the city has, 
or, 
 that the city is intending on implementing in certain areas, 
 and how much is the city willing to bend and say, 
 I will g- -- 
we are gonna forego  these uh  scheduled or proposed projects, 
to be able to dovetail into  empowerment zones. 
GRANT:  What's being said, 
#Patty is, 
 when is the city going to present, 
say for instance, 
 its overall plan, 
for conducting the city. 
So everyone can see, 
 their seat, 
 in the auditorium, 
 or their .. place around the table, 
 and how long will they have to wait for their turn for development, 
 when will their interests be served, 
 so, 
 this empowerment zone, 
it simply seems to me, 
is opening a Pandora's Box. 
PATTY:  Go ahead. 
 Well to -- 
let me answer your question in terms of the um, 
 uh, 
 proposed plans, 
 I mean right now, 
 the= . um coordinating council, 
is making the selection, 
based on the information, 
 tha=t is received from the community. 
 And obviously there % there are . other issues to look at, 
 for example, 
 um, 
organizations that may be involved in  um .. current work, 
 their ability, 
new organizations, 
new ideas, 
(H) I mean all that is getting- -- 
 is thrown in the pot. 
(H) and I don't think that any  community that has an existing plan, 
 has a leg up, 
 o=n any one else who has a new idea that may not be part of a plan. 
DAN:  Uh, 
 are they explaining the uh- -- 
for example I -- 
 don't know if #Londa #White is here, 
s- uh theoretical- -- 
 at a uh, 
 a  uh community meeting last month, 
in which uh a lot of uh selection criteria were, 
 uh, 
 drawn up, 
I= was wondering, 
if is the council  gonna absorb that into the [selection process also], 
PATTY: [The council, 
has] uh, 
received a copy of that, 
and the council has seen portions of uh, 
 of the Seaway principles, 
(H) some of those principles have been -- 
 are [included] in what we have tonight, 
AUD: [(COUGH)] 
PATTY:  Others are really principles, 
fo=r the zo=ne itself, 
(H) and how the makeup of the zone will be. 
 And that is going to be handed out to the uh  Coordinating Council, 
this Thursday. 
DAN:  Uh, 
 m- m- my third question is on the final program? 
 I-  think this gentleman again spoke very, 
 very adequately to it, 
 u=m, 
 it seems to me, 
again, 
 this idea of building consensus. 
 That, 
 if we're able to make this -- 
a program like this work, 
over  such a long time. 
 That the city -- 
 and in fact it's= stated in the uh, 
 uh=, 
proposal, 
the uh  HUD  application proposal that, 
 the uh, 
 governing body, 
 making the application, 
 must provide a- .. -ssurance and evidence, 
that this uh, 
 uh empowerment zone plan, 
is gonna be adhered to and implemented, 
and it seems to me that, 
 one of the . most fundawen- .. fundamental and best ways to have this done, 
 would be for the city to come up with a com[prehensive plan], 
AUD: [(COUGH) (COUGH)] 
DAN:  that follows guidelines, 
that would  ensure, 
 that what's happening in the empowerment zone, 
is indeed the seed program that's gonna be followed, 
and be able to be dis-  distributed to other areas of the city and, 
 and built on in other areas of the city, 
 does the city have .. any, 
 uh, 
 plans, 
uh any any  hope of, 
 coming up with a comprehensive plan, 
for developing the city? 
PATTY:  We do not have a comprehensive plan for  the city of Chicago. 
DAN:  Does the city have & 
PATTY:  We have & 
DAN: & any [hopes of], 
PATTY: & [policies] for development, 
 and we have been identifying (H) places, 
 that have plans, 
 and .. trying to get things done. 
(H) A comprehensive plan, 
requires, 
(H) uh, 
 the infusion of .. many many dollars, 
 much more than is available, 
 you know, 
 within the city budget, 
to implement a plan, 
 a=nd, 
at this point, 
we are looking at, 
ways to be strategic, 
 in how we invest our money, 
 and the empowerment zone is an 0.000000e+00- is an example, 
 of an of an area where we are going to  do some strategic planning along with the community, 
which will lead to implementation, 
and investing in our plan. 
DAN:  Correct. 
Would you say it's only, 
 we only have policy guidelines. 
and when- -- 
 when administrations change, 
 policies change. 
 What I'm talking about is that, 
 cities that we are competing against, 
Seattle, 
 San Antonio, 
Minneapolis, 
 they've got, 
 comprehensive plans, 
for the development of their cities. 
 And, 
[that] -- 
PATTY: [some of] them do and some of them do not. 
DAN: The ones that I just mentioned do. 
PATTY: % 
DAN:  Alright? 
PATTY: (Hx) 
DAN: And, 
 my [point is, 
PATTY: [Some of them do, 
DAN: that], 
PATTY: and] some of them do not. 
DAN:  The ones that I just mentioned do. 
 And, 
 my -- 
 my point is, 
 that, 
it seems to us that, 
it- it-  it seems to me that, 
it would give us= as  Chicago, 
(H) a much better footing with government, 
if we said, 
that we had a comprehensive plan, 
that was gonna ensure, 
 that these things are going to be, 
PATTY:  Well sir, 
DAN: [XX XX X] 
PATTY: [considering that our plan] is due June thirtieth, 
(H) and considering that between now and then, 
we will not have a comprehensive plan, 
for the city of Chicago, 
(H) u=m, 
 I'm not quite sure where to go with your question. 
AUD:  (COUGH) (COUGH) 
PATTY:  Oh I'm s- -- 
 [I'm sorry, 
DEREK: [Oh, 
BERNIE:  go ahead. 
go ahead]. 
PATTY:  <X #Bernie X>]. 
BERNIE: I- ha- -- 
 [<X I just] wanted to make a friendly .. remind X>. 
PATTY: X (Hx)] 
I'm sorry #Derek. 
DEREK: Um, 
 My name's #Derek #Williams, 
I'm -- 
 I'm with the HORN association of men, 
 a=nd uh, 
 %I I think we need to recognize that uh, 
 uh this is an opportunity, 
and it's not a threat. 
 Uh, 
 consensus do not build themselves. 
 A=nd, 
and if we just be perfectly honest with each other, 
 the only reason that we're all in this room is because we hear=d, 
 about a hundred million dollars. 
MANY: (LAUGHTER) 
DEREK: And that's what everybody's worried about. 
 Uh, 
 it's impossible for any city to have a comprehensive plan, 
because we don't have comprehensive people. 
 First of all. 
 And I think we just need to, 
 given the information that's out there, 
 we need to try to make it as meaningful as we can to our constituents. 
 Uh=, 
 be honestly speaking with you, 
 uh I come from an organization with . five hundred members, 
 and empowerment zone has  absolutely no meaning, 
 to just about eighty percent of our population. 
 For the simple reason, 
 we get caught up in, 
 in in all of the rhetoric, 
 u=m, 
 we we constantly challenge each other, 
and I- -- 
I don't think this is the time for that. 
 I I think we should be trying to focus o=n, 
 the information that's available, 
 and and and meet the challenge. 
And I and I think we can do that. 
 And in -- 
 and again, 
this is an opportunity, 
 to  m=eet the challenge. 
MANY:  ((APPLAUSE)) 
PATTY:  Thanks #Derek, 
that's why I guess you're sitting in the front row. 
@@@@ 
(H) Um #Paul. 
PAUL:  #Derek I -- 
 I appreciate following you. 
DEREK:  Thanks. 
PAUL:  Well see I'd've been kinda . frustrated, 
trying to say what you said, 
some of it. 
 I'd like to, 
just for a couple minutes, 
 set the record straight, 
o=n what empowerment zones are, 
 and what they are not, 
 according to my own . understanding. 
 The empowerment zones, 
 were . implemented. 
 under the Clinton administration. 
 They did not start . under the Clinton administration. 
 They started in the state of Illinois, 
 as enterprise zones, 
back in the eighties. 
 The difference between  empowerment zones, 
 and enterprise zones, 
is that the federal government, 
 for twelve years, 
 Congress never did approve, 
 enterprise zones, 
 at the federal level. 
 By the time they were approved, 
 Congress, 
in its wisdom, 
 attached . funding. 
 criteria. 
 and shifted the name from enterprise zones, 
 to empowerment zones. 
 For the record. 
 I do not live  in CHA. 
 I am not . homeless. 
 I do not  transport myself, 
 on CTA properties. 
 I'm a veteran, 
 so I do not go  to county hospitals. 
 I abide by the law, 
 so I'm not in  county jail. 
 I have . attended .. several colleges, 
 I think successfully, 
 they think  unsuccessfully, 
 so I do not need  the public education system, 
 in Chicago. 
 But, 
 I do know, 
who does_(/uz/)  need em. 
 The homeless, 
 and people not in  public housing. 
 Public housing, 
 because one, 
 we're getting ready, 
to tear them all down. 
 What are we gonna do with it. 
 The= city  has no right, 
 <X would be in a fight X>, 
 <X we need X>, 
 to try and tell me, 
 what my block needs, 
 When my block decides, 
 what it needs, 
 and presents its plan, 
 to the city, 
 then the city, 
 can take its logical, 
 legal, 
 jurisprudence, 
 course, 
 of identifying, 
 what  resources it has, 
 and make em available. 
 The empowerment zones, 
 what are, 
 by legislation, 
 to be planned, 
 by, 
 with, 
 and for, 
 those most in need of empowering. 
 It don't mention, 
 those agencies, 
 most in need. 
This is not the entitlement programs. 
(H) See the entitlement programs is what has turned the West Side, 
(H) into a damn desert  of oasis and poverty. 
 Because the West Side was planned  for. 
 CHA was planned  for. 
 The city  has put together in a aggregate sum, 
(H) the map that is about two pages, 
(H) that shows you where the poorest folks live. 
 If you are an agency, 
 that is involved in those areas, 
 take the opportunity to find out what those people need, 
 and deliver the proposal. 
 If you are an agency that is outside of those areas, 
of the census track, 
that each of you have, 
 then, 
 cha=nge your location, 
 do like Reagan said, 
 and move with your feet  into the area. 
 This is no, 
you know, 
three card <X Molly X> here. 
 We al=ready know, 
 where the most <MRC empower- .. -less .. people .. are MRC>. 
 Get busy. 
 #Patty asked a question earlier. 
 I have  chose not to do it, 
 but out of necessity, 
 I'm gonna ask you to  walk through this, 
 this is where the poor folks live. 
 This is where your tax dollars are going. 
(H) And this is why you get upset, 
every time the city launches a project, 
(H) because you say, 
 it comes in over budget. 
 This is where the state  has roads going on. 
 This is where county hospital has roads going on. 
(H) So as far as I'm concerned, 
(H) if the city did anything more than what it was doing, 
(H) I would file a grievance with the Department of Justice, 
to say that they were in violation  of the legislation. 
 The legislation says that, 
 tho=se who have nothing, 
 are either to be courted  by those who have something, 
(H) or left alone. 
 so that they can develop, 
 their own plan, 
and be responsible for their success, 
 or their failure. 
 That to me  is the empowerment zone. 
 Anything else, 
 is a contradiction, 
 Malcolm X, 
we  sitting in the college named after him, 
(H) he said by whatever means necessary. 
(H) So by whatever means necessary it takes for you to get <X gautonomous X>, 
(H) touched, 
 contagious, 
(H) in in love with  poor folks. 
 is what is gonna take, 
 to keep your agencies, 
 empowered. 
MANY:  ((APPLAUSE))[=]= 
PATTY: [Thank you #Paul]. 
Um, 
 before we close, 
we have uh several members of the Coordinating Council here, 
who I'd like to recognize, 
and see if they  want to add anything, 
before we  leave uh .. here tonight. 
(H) Um, 
 we have #Sproule #White, 
who is the executive director of the Chicago Jobs Council, 
 um, 
 #Wanda #White, 
who is the executive director of the Community Work[shop on] Economic Development, 
AUD: [(COUGH) 
PATTY: (H) and #Ted #Wysaki, 
who is the executive director of, 
 uh, 
CANDO, 
the Chicago Association of Neighborhood Development  Organizations, 
and also, 
#Frank #Grossman was here, 
(H) from Continental Bank. 
 And also the chair of the capital improvement advisory committee. 
 Do you wanna say anything? 
X:  Okay. 
CHERYL:  I'll just . make one point, 
and I'll make it brief, 
and that is, 
PHIL:  Coo=l. 
 (H) Alright folks (Hx). 
 Well alreet (hx), 
well alroot (hx), 
well alright. 
(H) By now I'm sure you're wondering about the different things that I have on the table here, 
but first, 
(H)  I would like to  talk to you about these three items. 
I have here, 
(H) some ice in a pan, 
(H) water in this glass, 
 and steam rising from this pot. 
(H)  Now=. 
 I would like to ask you, 
how these three things. 
 Tell me please. 
(H) How are they all alike. 
 (H) These three things. 
This ice here in this pan. 
(H) This water in this glass, 
and the steam rising from this pot, 
just yell it out, 
w=e are informal here, 
yes. 
(H)  Correct. 
 They are all forms of water. 
This ice here of course is water, 
(H) I told you there was water in this glass, 
 and you have all seen water boil at home, 
so you are familiar with steam. 
(H) But now let's try to figure out how they're different, 
we'll look at temperature, 
(H) first. 
And the temperature o=f this water here, 
the ice, 
 i=s, 
(H)  about uh twenty-four- -- 
n_woo. 
Nineteen degrees. 
Very cold. 
(H) The temperature o=f this %w- water here, 
is sixty-four degrees, 
(H) the temperature of this steam, 
i=s, 
 <PAR I know it's hotter than that PAR>. 
 Yeah, 
it's about a hundred a=nd eleven degrees. 
 Okay. 
(H) (Hx)= Fahrenheit. 
 Okay. 
(H) Oh, 
and by the way guys, 
what do we call something that's hard, 
like this ice here, 
or a table, 
or a rock. 
(H) We call it a? 
MANY:  Solid. 
PHIL: (H) Very good. 
You should g- -- 
you should be a choir. 
 You should go out on the road there, 
like, 
 yeah. 
: (H) 
AUD:  [We are]. 
PHIL: [(H)] Y- -- 
 Oh well, 
 I'm glad to meet you. 
@@ (H) 
Plea=se give me your itinerary after the show. 
Yes. 
(H) Yes. 
 Of course we call it a sholids. 
A solid. 
And a solid has one shape. 
(H) The shape that it starts out with. 
(H)= And what do we call something that you- -- 
 that you can splish splash. 
Take a bath in. 
[Anything wet] like soda or milk. 
MANY: [Liquid]. 
PHIL: You're not gonna let me finish, 
are you. 
(H) Yes, 
we call it a, 
AUD:  Liquid. 
PHIL: Very good. 
And a liquid  can change its shape, 
(H)  to f- completely fill the bottom of whatever container you put it in. 
(H) And finally, 
what do we call something that's loose, 
and floating around like this steam here. 
(H) O=r a cloud, 
or the air we breathe, 
we call it a, 
MANY: Gas. 
PHIL: (H) Correct. 
a gas. 
And a ga=s completely fi=lls whatever shape container (H) you put it in. 
(H) And so, 
how do you get water to change, 
(H) from a solid, 
(H) to a liquid, 
 to a gas, 
 and back and forth. 
AUD: Add energy. 
PHIL: (H) Woo=. 
I like the way he expressed that. 
Never before have I heard it, 
(H) a=dd  or subtract energy,

(H) Oh we can also start to see (H) bubbles in the water. 
(H) The water that was sitting at the bottom of this flask,

 (H) That's what we call boiling folks,

 But it would still be water. 
Yes you're right. 
(H)  Whether it's a solid,

Well water is made up of  atoms. 
 (H) <VOX Yeah VOX>. 
Everything is made up of atoms. 
(H) Solids,

 Alright. 
So. 
 (TSK) Folks.

(H)  from the molecules in the water [when it's] steam. 
AUD: [<X Fast X>].

Not just in water, 
(H) but in everything in the universe. 
(H) <VOX Even you.

(H) But to get a better understanding of how those m=olecules interact, 
(H) let's= pretend these ping-pong balls here= (H) are molecules. 
(H) Well folks. 
(H) In a solid, 
(H) like this ice here. 
Or a table. 
(H) The molecules are moving [(H)] ve=ry slowly. 
>ENV: [<<MACHINE_STARTS] 
PHIL: Alright? 
 And they're very close together, 
 in fact .. they're in a v- .. <MRC joined uniform state MRC>. 
 (H) Okay, 
they move very coolly, 
 slowly,

(H) in a solid. 
Like the ice. 
But in a liquid, 
>ENV: ((MACHINE_LOUDER)) 
PHIL:  (H) the molecules are moving a little more quickly. 
 Okay? 
So you have some  fluidity of movement within a fixed volume. 
(H) Okay, 
they're a= little mo=re  further apart there, 
 (H) but in a gas, 
>ENV: ((MACHINE_LOUDER)) 
PHIL:  <VOX look at that. 
(H) They're moving ve=ry quickly indeed. 
Alright VOX>? 
(H) They're moving so fast they completely fill the shape container, 
 % . 
>ENV: MACHINE_STOPS>> 
PHIL:  That's what it's like in a gas. 
 <VOX And temperature is a measurement of how fast  or slow (H) molecules are moving VOX>. 
So if you have (H) <VOX slow= moving molecules VOX>, 
(H) what temperature do you have people. 
 (H) . Yes, 
 cold,

(H) And if you have fast moving molecules, 
what type of temperature do you have.

PHIL: (H) <VOX Hot or high temperature VOX>. 
(H) You're right. 
(H) But not every substance beco=mes, 
a solid,

at the same temperatures, 
(H) as water does. 
(H) And that brings us back to the mystery (H) <VOX of our disappearing balloons VOX>. 
Now inside this container here, 
into which our balloons, 
<HI<VOX ah VOX>HI>, 
(H) (TSK) I am losing my  spheres. 
(TSK) (H)  Inside this container, 
into which our balloons have disappeared,

 <VOX @@@@@@@ 
 (H) Yeah= VOX>. 
Alright guys. 
(H) Let's watch now and see what occurs. 
(H) I'm going to pour this liquid into this flask here, 
 (H)  and again, 
we will behave like scientists, 
and watch, 
and observe, 
and see what we  n=otice. 
 (H) Now here=  is a liquid. 
 That is bubbling and steaming, 
like the water was, 
(H) when there were the f- -- 
 when there was a fla=me underneath it. 
But, 
(H) there's no flame underneath this  liquid here. 
 N_that's different. 
 (H) Let's see, 
 what happens when I put a balloon o=ver the top. 
(H)  If we do in fact have a liquid, 
that's turning into a gas, 
with enough force to fill up a balloon, 
and lo and beho=ld, 
(H) <VOX we do VOX>. 
(H) It i=s filling up the balloon here. 
 But. 
 (H) . This steam here is very cold. 
And we can see that frost (H) is forming, 
on the sides of this <HI flask HI> here. 
 (H) <VOX Frost? 
 (H) My God VOX> (Hx). 
(H) That's curious. 
Let's see what the temperature is of this liquid.

(H) I'm going to put this probe here into this liquid, 
and we will see what temperature (H) this balloon is. 
Uh try to  stay in your seats, 
I don't want you guys to run up  throughout the show. 
 Okay, 
now the temperature of this liquid i=s, 
(H) three-hundred and twenty-three degrees below= zero=. 
(H) Water becomes a solid at thirty-two degrees above zero. 
And it remains a solid (H) at every tenjure- temperature below that.

do you think,

That's right,

Of course it's not water.

 it's oxygen,

(H) okay? 
 Our body takes it all in. 
(H) But we only u=se the oxygen. 
We breathe out the nitrogen. 
The reason why the nitrogen is not freezing our lungs, 
(H) as it is doing this flask here, 
(H) is because, 
(H) those molecules are moving much faster. 
(H) The  nitrogen is w=armer. 
Probably about seventy degrees I would imagine. 
(H) But, 
 <VOX this . liquid .. is ve=ry cold indeed. 
Three-hundred and twenty-three degrees below= zero= VOX>.

 to get exactly, 
 to get an idea about how cold that is, 
let's use these two  bouncing rubber balls. 
I would like you people in the audience to, 
(H) examine the balls.

let's see what happens, 
when one of these balls goes into the <VOX liquid (H) nitrogen VOX>. 
Now the other one stays out here, 
(H) with me. 
 Where it's nice and warm. 
(H)=  Well let's think now about what's happening to this ball. 
 It's in the <VOX ve=ry cold VOX> liquid nitrogen. 
Right? 
(H) So. 
 What do you think is happening to the ball. 
Is the ball getting hotter (H) or colder. 
Everybody say it out lou=d. 
AUD: Hotter. 
MANY:  Colder. 
PHIL: (H) Colder. 
Okay, 
 <PAR some people don't agree with you. 
 In fact most people don't PAR>. 
(H)= Yes, 
it's getting colder. 
(H) So if the ball is getting colder, 
do you think the ball='s m=olecules, 
(H) are going faster? 
 Or slower. 
MANY: Slower. 
PHIL: (H) Slower, 
okay. 
And that  you all .. concur. 
That is excellent. 
(H) So, 
if these molecules are going slower, 
(H) do you think -- 
 and the ball is getting colder, 
do you think the ball is becoming (H) <MRC more of a solid MRC>? 
 Or more of a liquid. 
What do you think. 
AUD:  Liquid. 
PHIL: (H) A l=iquid, 
only one person thinks that, 
cause everybody didn't want to go all that far out on a limb. 
So let's see, 
(H)  if uh,

If it becomes more of a liquid, 
or more of a solid. 
I will take this ball <VOX out VOX> (H) o=f the liquid nitrogen, 
and we will begin  the experiments. 
(H) Okay, 
now. 
 Let's see, 
 they look alike, 
don't they, 
they still look  pretty much the same, 
except we have steam coming off this ball here, 
let's see (H) if they bounce  as before.

 (H) Alright, 
I'm pouring the very cold liquid nitrogen over this balloon. 
 (H) So the balloon and its contents, 
the air insi=de, 
is getting colder and colder and colder. 
(H) Okay those molecules are slowing down. 
They're going slower and slower,

Okay? 
(H) You still have the same num=ber of air molecules inside this balloon,

 And look  at the balloon.

You can see a liquid.

 the molecules are speeding up, 
they're getting further and further apart,

these balloons are in the very cold liquid nitrogen,

JILL:  [3Totally3].

 (H) I let -- 
There were a couple times when I wanted to call you, 
and I didn't [for that] reason. 
JILL: [Uh], 
 Unhu=nh. 
Aw thanks. 
 (H) Yeah, 
well the thing was, 
 I hadn't told you? 
 (H) But my period is r=eally l=ate. 
 You know? 
And I guess, 
 we would talk, 
and then we'd hang up, 
and then I thought, 
oh, 
go=sh, 
I forgot to tell you. 
[(H) But] -- 
JEFF: [I've been] meaning to ask you about that.

You were [<X getting nervous X> --

JILL: (H)] No=. 
 I mean, 
 and it's been so= .. long. 
And so it's like  eight days late? 
(H) And I thought, 
I'm su=re I'm pregnant. 
I'm  p=ositive. 
[And I was waiting till Jill got] here?

so we went  to go get .. an EPT.

That's why we were calling you last nigh=t. 
 You know?

JEFF: [What happened]. 
JILL:  And then, 
 @ of course it came out fine. 
(H) So [that's the] -- 
JEFF: [It] came out negative? 
JILL: Yeah, 
so that's the relief and the ecstasy. 
JEFF:  So, 
 (H) y- you can't be pregnant. 
JILL:  No. 
 I don't -- 
 No. 
Un[less] it was a false negative. 
JEFF: [X] 
JILL: which  I doubt. 
(H) [Because] -- 
JEFF: [(TSK) That's rare]. 
Right? 
JILL:  Right. 
 I think that would be really rare. 
JEFF:  So, 
 (H) th%-  you know what I mean,

 would it come out nega- -- 
Let's say i- i 0f you were pregnant,

 [You know what I'm saying?

JEFF: Like could you get --

JILL:  (H) I think .. there'd be a slight chance, 
 of it being a false .. negative. 
 (H) But, 
 I don't think so, 
cause I'm pretty late? 
And I think I'm late enough, 
(H) where I would have,

 enough of .. the hormone that .. the pregnancy test tests for? 
(H) I think I would have enough of that in my urine, 
that  of course it would show up.

right? 
LARRY:  Two-story, 
SETH:  Th- -- 
Are there <X any X> registers on the second floor? 
LARRY: Unhunh. 
SETH:  Okay.

are the ones that go up [through the] wall. 
SETH: [Oh]. 
 Okay. 
LARRY:  (H) (TSK) 
SETH: Well that's no [problem], 
LARRY: [Uh], 
SETH: as long as I don't have to do (H) any ducting to the second floor. 
LARRY: yeah. 
 No. 
 <X They X> only -- 
the only thing that we wanted you to do is tie into the existing ones, 
SETH:  Okay. 
LARRY:  which are on the ground level, 
SETH:  How about that one right there. 
Is that one? 
LARRY:  Uh, 
yeah. 
 That's one as well. 
 And then the return is  back here. 
SETH:  Okay. 
 Good sized return. 
LARRY:  Yeah. 
SETH: Now you're not looking at %  adding air conditioning. 
 Right? 
LARRY: Well, 
 [we would] like to have that as an option. 
SETH: [X] 
 [2Okay]. 
LARRY: [2We could2] always add that later. 
Right? 
SETH:  Yeah. 
One of the things you can do, 
if  if you don't wanna do it now, 
 you can, 
 what they call, 
 prep for air conditioning. 
You can put in the coil. 
 See you've [got the] furnace and the coil, 
LARRY: [<X Yeah X>]. 
SETH: (H) and then, 
 when you add air conditioning in the future, 
 all you gotta do is put the outdoor condensing unit, 
 and refrigerant piping to that coil. 
 So it  saves -- 
 it saves= additional work in the future. 
LARRY:  Mhm. 
SETH: Otherwise you gotta come back and put the coil in, 
which means you gotta modify the duct work, 
to [get that] coil in there so, 
LARRY: [Right]. 
SETH:  (H) if you're thinking about doing it in the future, 
you might wanna at least put the coil in. 
It only  costs about three-hundred fifty dollars for the coil. 
LARRY: Oh. 
 Alright. 
SETH:  It's the it's the out[door air conditioning <X that X>] -- 
LARRY: [Well, 
 write that in] there, 
anyway in the  in the quote. 
SETH:  (TSK) And now that's the  the dining room you wanna add? 
LARRY: Yeah. 
If you -- 
if you go over and have a look at the dining room, 
SETH: You got a lotta glass in that room it looks like. 
LARRY: yeah, 
 and % we're gonna be making changes to the  to the house too, 
so we're  keeping that in mind. 
But if you notice, 
there are no registers in here. 
 So, 
SETH:  (H) Is this accessible? 
LARRY:  oh yeah]. 
SETH: [I wonder] -- 
I wonder if, 
 [was this] added on you think, 
LARRY: [(SNIFF)] 
SETH:  maybe? 
 I'm just wondering if that [2foun2]dation wall & 
LARRY: [2M-2] -- 
 It might've been. 
SETH: & goes to that, 
 I wonder if I can get .. into this. 
LARRY: Oh you can get into it. 
Yeah. 
SETH:  [Okay]. 
LARRY: [Oh yeah]. 
I've been under here. 
SETH:  Oh okay. 
 [Good]. 
LARRY: [So], 
this is not a problem. 
SETH:  Shoot I'd probab[ly go] with two registers in this room. 
LARRY: [X] -- 
 Alright. 
[X] -- 
SETH: [I'd] probably go like [2one here2], 
LARRY: [2<X Oh yeah X>2], 
SETH: and one  [3one there3]. 
LARRY: [3you'd do one3] over there as well? 
SETH:  Cause it's a good-sized room with a lot of glass. 
LARRY:  Okay. 
SETH:  Or you could do it, 
 you know, 
you could put like one on this wall, 
and one on that wall. 
LARRY:  Okay, 
on the two  two out[side- -- 
SETH: [And then I'd] probably tie em both together, 
LARRY: Yeah]. 
SETH:  into one Y-branch, 
 you know like the room, 
LARRY:  Mhm. 
SETH:  the room is shaped somewhat like this. 
 <X I could X> put like one there, 
 one there, 
LARRY: Now what we'd want you to do, 
in this case, 
is maybe -- 
SETH:  tie those together like that. 
LARRY:  See this this -- 
The end of this room might be modified. 
 So, 
 all we wanna know is, 
 is that we can eventually be able to do this. 
 Alright. 
 To to get %  get this= ... duct work done, 
when we do -- 
when we do the modification to [the] -- 
SETH: [Oh], 
so you may not do the duct work at this point? 
LARRY: [Not  not in this room. 
SETH: [X  XX .. do it in the future]. 
LARRY: We m-] --

SETH: [2Well what would 2] the modification be. 
LARRY:  Oh we might take this out,

and, 
 uh, 
 well, 
here's the drawings, 
right here. 
 <0h=,

LARRY: you can see that -- 
(H) this is the current [wall],

so are you gonna go out [2like  three feet or so2], 
LARRY: [2So we might -- 
 we might2] -- 
 we might %= .. [3do a little modification. 
SETH: [3a tape-  tapered uh .. corners3].

(H) So we might do  a little .. of that. 
SETH:  Okay. 
LARRY: But, 
 if you're gonna  put it in h- .. this end wall, 
then, 
 maybe it wouldn't be affected. 
 That one might down there. 
 Because, 
we might uh, 
SETH:  [Yeah], 
LARRY: [XX] 
SETH: see well, 
LARRY:  (H) See [eventually <X we have s- X>] -- 
SETH: [you know you're right. 
 Cause I] -- 
 cause we're looking at right there, 
 course, 
 now you gonna go out -- 
LARRY:  That's right. 
See we're opening this, 
SETH: That's [gonna go that way]. 
LARRY: [that -- 
 <X it's X>] -- 
 that that that's going out to this master, 
 which is gonna go up on the hill. 
SETH:  Aw, 
so you'll need -- 
 What about .. heating for that. 
LARRY:  Well, 
 what we're gonna do is put uh .. radiated heat. 
SETH:  Okay. 
LARRY: In- in there. 
SETH:  [That'll be a slab] floor then. 
LARRY: [For sure]. 
Yeah, 
yeah. 
 (H) [Uh], 
SETH: [So that] one might change, 
LARRY:  (H) [2Yeah2]. 
SETH: [2uh=2], 
LARRY:  I- that's a that's a good point. 
I've  I I'm not .. uh, 
 we were th- -- 
SETH:  The only thing i=s, 
 I don't know how long, 
is that gonna be like  in the future, 
like a year down the road? 
LARRY:  Yeah. 
 [Probably]. 
SETH: [Cause it] would be nice to have heat in here (H) in the meantime. 
 I mean say you do the furnace, 
 It would be nice to have it  for this winter. 
LARRY: Well let me work that out with my wife. 
 Put that as a -- 
SETH:  But one thing you can do, 
even if you do a modification, 
you can move the register. 
 I mean say we put the register right . h=ere, 
 and that's gonna b- -- 
%= that would obviously have to be moved, 
 you know, 
it's not a [big deal] to move it from here to here. 
LARRY: [Yeah]. 
SETH: You might have to add a piece of duct work, 
(H) but it's not gonna be a major change, 
LARRY: Okay. 
 Okay. 
SETH:  And this one you may not have to move at all. 
That may be okay. 
LARRY:  Alright. 
SETH:  But then that's probably how I'd do it, 
some-  something like that, 
or, 
if I had the registers  going that way, 
 that might be the best way to do it. 
 It'd be like for- fourteen by six, 
LARRY:  (SNIFF) (SNIFF) (SNIFF) 
SETH: I mean that would probably be an eight-inch duct, 
that'd be an eight-inch, 
that'd be a ten-inch, 
 and then the furnace, 
I don't know, 
it's somewhere over there (Hx) [in that area], 
LARRY: [Furnace=]  [2is=2] -- 
SETH: [2I'm not sure how many feet2], 
LARRY: Well the furnace sits down, 
 over in this, 
 this corner over here. 
 That's where the furnace is. 
SETH:  One. 
 Two. 
LARRY:  Probab[ly] right  in here. 
SETH: [Three]. 
LARRY:  And now -- 
That's probably what- -- 
that's one of the & 
SETH: That's about [thirty] -- 
LARRY: & key] 
my key [2concerns2], 
SETH: [2about thirty-six2] feet across. 
LARRY: is th-  is the how noisy the furnace is. 
 That's a real concern to me. 
 A=nd uh, 
I don't know what they've got these days, 
 if they're all -- 
 %= I know there's pulse type furnaces, 
which evidently are kinda lou=d or something,

 Yeah. 
Lennox pulse.

LARRY: oh [@really]? 
SETH: [(H)] That's a loud one. 
LARRY: Is it?

SETH: I've put a few of those in, 
[and they], 
LARRY: [<X Have you X>]. 
SETH: (H)  I've had problems. 
I wouldn't go with the Lennox pulse. 
LARRY: Okay. 
SETH:  If I go [with a=] uh, 
LARRY: [Well], 
SETH: I'd probably go with the Carrier. 
 Carrier furnace. 
(H) The return grill's plenty big enough. 
LARRY:  yeah. 
It's a big [return, 
SETH: [I mean I can't -- 
you can't] have any kind of problem [2there2], 
LARRY: and a] -- 
[2and2] and the pipes are big enough, 
so=, 
and that's normally when you get -- 
 you get .. a lot of noise .. in the house. 
(H) Is if your= -- 
 if your uh . ducts are too small. 
Right? 
SETH: Right. 
 (H) Yeah, 
y- the two main sources of noise, 
 are either, 
 uh=, 
 air noise, 
 which is due to undersized grills, 
LARRY: Really? 
SETH: you got air rushing through there at high velocity. 
(H) The other source of noise is th-  is the fan motor itself. 
(H) 
LARRY: In the- in the actual -- 
SETH:  In the .. unit itself. 
LARRY: Unhunh. 
SETH: And that's usually solved by b-, 
just having flexible duct between the unit  and the d- and the registers, 
so that it dampens out the noise. 
(H) In other words if we had the furnace like right behind that wall=, 
(H) it would be noisy. 
LARRY:  Yeah. 
SETH: But we're going d- -- 
I'm not sure how it  connects, 
 did we see that down there? 
 I'll have to go down and take a look at that again [but, 
LARRY: [Okay]. 
SETH: (H)] I imagine it goes dow=n, 
 (H) and then we can run some kind of a flexible duct to the unit. 
As long as I can get say ten feet or so between that and the unit, 
 (H) [then I] -- 
LARRY: [You can]. 
SETH:  then I can= uh  eliminate th- .. the noise problem. 
LARRY:  Alright. 
SETH:  So it's basically thirty by thirty, 
 return air. 
 Thirty by thirty return air. 
LARRY:  And this is a uh=, 
this is the only return, 
and I'd= -- 
I would [say not -- 
SETH: [Oh this is return also]? 
LARRY:  not placed], 
 not placed very well, 
in the room. 
SETH:  [This is] -- 
LARRY: [So], 
SETH: this is supply though. 
Right? 
LARRY:  this is the supply. 
Right. 
SETH: Okay. 
 (H) Yeah. 
LARRY:  See, 
and I'd (Hx) -- 
 Where would you suggest .. they would go. 
If uh, 
 if we put uh, 
SETH:  Boy. 
 I would say g-, 
I'd probably go with two. 
 I'd put one on each side, 
I'd probably put one like right underneath that window there, 
 and maybe underneath that window. 
 Be nice to put it behind the couch, 
but then you've -- 
it would be blocked off too much. 
LARRY:  And you thi- -- 
you so you  you p- you try and put em= under windows, 
where  that's where [your] -- 
SETH: [(Hx)]  Yeah. 
I try to [put em] on=  the cold- -- 
LARRY: [X] -- 
SETH: basically the coldest part of the room (Hx). 
LARRY: Okay. 
SETH:  (TSK) Because uh, 
 it just helps, 
%y=  because otherwise, 
%you know, 
with a grill right here, 
(H)  you end up having cold spots on the sides. 
LARRY: Mhm. 
SETH: Cause what happens is, 
the air goes b=ack to the return grill, 
(H) [so it never really, 
LARRY: [<X It wouldn't get X> out circulating through] -- 
SETH: it never really blows] out  to the corners. 
LARRY: [2Right]. 
SETH: [2So that's why I2] try to put it  as far away (H) on the perimeter, 
and have it pull across the room. 
LARRY:  Okay. 
well this is the on[ly -- 
SETH: [So I don't know if you'd wanna] -- 
LARRY:  % the only the only] other addition room, 
where we thought maybe registers would be important. 
 And I'd, 
 I don't know if, 
 uh=, 
 floor registers? 
Are there -- 
are- th- i- i- i- is- d- does it -- 
 that's not a good idea these days? 
SETH:  No, 
I would go with floor registers in this house, 
cause you got high ceilings. 
LARRY:  % [XX] 
SETH: [Well in fact], 
you wouldn't be able to (H) put any kind of ceiling register in. 
 Cause you get the second floor. 
LARRY: Right. 
SETH:  So, 
no. 
Floor registers are fine, 
for heating. 
LARRY:  But th- -- 
you're talking about wa=ll regis- -- 
 putting em in the wall here. 
SETH:  No, 
I was- I was thinking about putting em in the floor. 
LARRY: Oh in the floor? 
SETH:  Yeah to- -- 
 to go in the wa=ll, 
would be  pretty tough. 
LARRY: Okay. 
 Alright. 
SETH: I don't know if you wanna cut the floor though. 
LARRY:  Yeah. 
 Well I hate to do it right there. 
May- maybe we'd do it right in here. 
SETH:  Yeah. 
 But to get in the wall [would be] almost -- 
LARRY: [X] 
SETH:  I mean you can do that during new construction, 
but it's tough  when you're coming back after the fact, 
cause <X you= just X> got,

LARRY: Sure. 
SETH: your- your two-by-four framing, 
 and it's just too tough to get in there. 
LARRY:  Okay. 
 Alright. 
So we'd put a couple in this room somewhere? 
 [And then uh], 
SETH: [So this is like] a= family room? 
Is that what this is?

 I would definitely go with a new thermostat. 
LARRY:  Yeah. 
 Kind of a [ X antique, 
SETH: [But that's probably a good -- 
 that's probably] a good spot. 
LARRY: isn't it]. 
SETH: Yeah, 
that should be in a museum. 
LARRY:  @@@@@ 
 Uh, 
 I don't know. 
 I- i- are we doing the right -- 
If I'm supposed to kinda walk you around the house here? 
Is that what uh -- 
SETH:  Yeah. 
Do you think, 
>ENV: ((RADIO_BECOMES_INAUDIBLE)) 
SETH:  well, 
 I guess you [haven't really] -- 
LARRY: [I don't know] if there's anything you need to do up here. 
Other than the fact <X just X> kinda know that we've got em. 
SETH:  Yeah, 
you haven't  r- really lived in the house .. during the winter. 
Have you? 
LARRY: No. 
 @@ 
[(H) And that's what we th- -- 
SETH: [So you don't really know=, 
if there's a] -- 
LARRY: See and that's what] we thought we would do, 
uh (Hx), 
SETH: So you're not really sure if there's any problems, 
 with heating certain areas, 
LARRY:  That's right. 
 [so <X I sa- X>] -- 
SETH: [So we don't know] if there's any particular areas, 
like that b- -- 
I bet you that parlor room has had a hard time, 
 in the past. 
LARRY: @ [<@ Do you think it's pretty] cool in there @>? 
SETH: [Just  that one grill]. 
LARRY: (H) And then this guy has a  register, 
so, 
SETH: Oh they got AC up here too. 
LARRY:  yeah. 
 I n- I think that's gonna go. 
SETH:  Well uh, 
 [especially if] you get the forced air [2(H)2] heating and cooling, 
LARRY: [Well], 
[2Yes2]. 
SETH: you won't need that. 
LARRY:  One little guy there. 
SETH:  Yeah see these aren't  strategically placed either, 
but you've  pretty much got no choice. 
 (H)  On most of these, 
these -- 
it's almost impossible to  to change these now, 
 but really on the second floor, 
LARRY:  This one's [not too bad]. 
SETH: [(H)] the heat  the heat's gonna rise, 
 from the first floor anyway. 
LARRY: Yeah up to- -- 
You [know. 
SETH: [So= I] -- 
LARRY: And it'll] hold it in here real [2well2]. 
SETH: [2Yeah2]. 
 Typically, 
and- if anything you have 0verheating problems. 
LARRY:  Mm. 
[Yeah. 
SETH: [On the second floor]. 
LARRY: (H) Well] see that's what we wanted to do, 
is have some kind of a system, 
that we know we can shut off. 
 Certain  certain areas. 
Like if w- -- 
SETH:  One of the things we could do, 
I don't think they have any dampers here. 
Do they? 
 (H)  Oh they do. 
LARRY:  (H) Yeah. 
SETH:  [So you can close off] -- 
LARRY: [Oh okay. 
 <X So that's] how it's X> -- 
SETH:  Yeah you can close off [2 individual d-2] -- 
LARRY: [2Close these off2], 
SETH:  [3(H)3] 
LARRY: [3and then the-3] -- 
 then it'll force the air what. 
 Down into -- 
SETH:  (H) Downstairs. 
[Now, 
LARRY: [X] 
SETH: the] one thing you don't wanna do though, 
is close off=  too many of em. 
LARRY:  [Cause then you put a strain on the]= -- 
SETH: [Cause  cause then you're uh=] -- 
 yeah, 
you've gotta have a certain amount of air, 
(H) for the furnace to work properly. 
 And if you reduce the airflow too much, 
 (H) then it won't have enough air going across .. the heat exchanger, 
and it'll -- 
 it'll overheat the heat exchanger. 
LARRY: Oh. 
 Really? 
 Okay. 
SETH:  So I would say, 
>ENV: ((RADIO_BECOMES_AUDIBLE)) 
SETH: you don't want to close more than uh, 
 more than about twenty-five percent of em. 
 Or you can close em, 
%y= you know, 
if you close em uh %a=- a hundred percent. 
If you close em all the way, 
 you probably don't want to shut more than (hx) twenty-five percent of em. 
All the way. 
LARRY:  (Hx)= 
SETH:  Which would b- -- 
 I'm not sure, 
(H) maybe all upstairs, 
 (H) you might wanna leave em cracked open just a little bit [though. 
LARRY: [Unhunh]? 
SETH: Just] to make sure you get enough air, 
LARRY: Yeah. 
SETH:  (H) But, 
okay, 
so we'd be looking at adding two, 
 two registers for that  parlor room? 
LARRY:  Adding two to that [parlor room], 
SETH: [And then what about that one]. 
Do you wanna hold off on that? 
LARRY: Well, 
maybe we should jus=t -- 
SETH:  Or would you wanna do at least one of em? 
LARRY:  (TSK) %= I think we should do something, 
yeah. 
Only because -- 
SETH:  Because if that [.. remodel's a year away then], 
LARRY: [I I th- -- 
<X I guess I th- X> -- 
I think] this thing is gonna be a cold little -- 
SETH:  oh, 
I can def[initely @see that @@]. 
LARRY: [I I I can tell you] that, 
because the windows, 
SETH:  See you only <X like X> -- 
 the only heat you have in this room, 
is that  one register over there. 
LARRY:  the windows in this thing are <<THUMP ++ just a+bout +ready +to ++fall out. 
+ I +mean +they're THUMP>> -- 
 they're not -- 
 Look at this. 
 So I know there's gonna be a lot of uh -- 
SETH:  A lotta infiltration. 
LARRY: Yeah. 
Until we get this corrected. 
SETH:  See hopefully you'll go with double-pane glass on your remodel. 
LARRY:  X[XX] 
SETH: [That'll help] cut down a lot. 
LARRY: Yeah. 
SETH: On your & 
LARRY: [Yeah]. 
SETH: & heat loss. 
LARRY:  So, 
 I mean, 
 %= in some ways, 
having windows, 
 is it a bad idea? 
Because you get a lot of natural  heat from the the s- from sun. 
SETH:  [That's right]. 
LARRY: [<X You knowX>]. 
SETH:  Okay this is like it would [2get2] -- 
LARRY: [2So2], 
SETH: This is like east facing. 
Right? 
(H) 
LARRY: Yeah. 
The [s- in in] -- 
SETH: [So you get some morning] sun. 
LARRY: You get the morning, 
in the winter, 
it's gonna come right across like [this]. 
SETH: [Yeah]. 
LARRY: So, 
[XX] 
SETH: [So that's gonna be] good. 
LARRY: So that'll be good. 
So maybe one register in here for the moment, 
 until we kinda feel it out [would be= uh], 
SETH: [(SNIFF)  Sure]. 
 I mean this one it looks like, 
 if we put a register over here, 
(H)  you wouldn't have to change it anyway. 
LARRY:  Yeah. 
 No that .. [that] -- 
SETH: [With your] remodel, 
that might  work into it. 
LARRY:  Yeah. 
SETH:  And like I say, 
even i- -- 
even if you do have to move it, 
 (H) it's not X a big deal. 
 I mean [somebody] . just moves it, 
LARRY: [Okay]. 
SETH:  you know, 
a carpenter can do it even. 
You don't even need to have us come out and do it really. 
 You might have to add a- -- 
 buy a piece of flexible duct and stick it on there, 
but [it's not a] -- 
LARRY: [Yeah]. 
SETH:  not a big deal. 
LARRY:  Okay. 
 Alright. 
SETH:  Okay? 
LARRY: Well that sounds good. 
SETH: Well let me check  downstairs again, 
I gotta take some measurements on that [room]. 
LARRY: [O]kay. 
 Well now you get -- 
you've got the logistics of every- -- 
Oh= wait. 
 [<X And then I think X>] my wife, 
SETH: [Now you -- 
 now you say about] -- 
LARRY:  my wife said she would like .. to have a register put in this room. 
 And I think it's kinda weird, 
but, 
 (Hx) what do you think. 
 Why would [she] -- 
SETH: [What is] this -- 
[2what is this room used for2]. 
LARRY: [2(TSK) (H) Well, 
even2]tually this is gonna be, 
(H)  uh= (Hx), 
 (TSK) . and we're gonna open this up. 
We're gonna take out some of these shelves, 
and get some light to come through here. 
SETH:  This is [sort of] like a pantry? 
LARRY: [But], 
kinda pantry area. 
 But it's gonna be (H) an extension of the kitchen. 
 Kind of. 
So, 
 (H) I don't know if % -- 
SETH: I'd -- 
 Yeah, 
I'd put -- 
I'd probably put one like right there. 
 [About right] there. 
LARRY: [(SNIFF)] 
SETH: You gonna be putting [2anything2] there? 
LARRY: [2<X<WH I think WH>X>2] -- 
SETH:  Probably something's gonna go there. 
Right? 
@A table or something? 
LARRY:  (H) I don't know. 
 I, 
[Yeah]. 
SETH: [Cause that's] about the only spot  you can put it. 
Well, 
I mean y- we could put a- -- 
we could put a floor r-  floor register right .. along here, 
I don't know if you'd want that. 
 But that's probably where I'd put it. 
 In fact the one that I was gonna put in there, 
[I'd probably] -- 
LARRY: [We might have] trouble getting to this spot though. 
I think. 
SETH: You think so? 
LARRY:  Yeah. 
 Cause it starts getting real tight up there on this end. 
 Yeah. 
 (H) Well, 
 let's uh, 
SETH:  Maybe on this end? 
LARRY:  Yeah. 
 It would have to be=, 
 if anywhere, 
 it'd have to be [down], 
SETH: [X that's] not a bad spot. 
LARRY:  okay. 
SETH:  It's gonna help out, 
cause I -- 
 See this whole area, 
(H) you've just got that one grill. 
 It's a pretty good-sized area right here. 
LARRY:  (H) Okay. 
SETH: What about [the kitchen]. 
LARRY: [Well let's] -- 
 let's consider [2that2] -- 
SETH: [2Kitchen's2] got one? 
LARRY:  kitchen's got one right here, 
SETH:  Yeah, 
okay. 
LARRY:  and uh, 
 I'm not too worried about the kitchen. 
I don't like hot kitchens anyway. 
 Cause I mean y- -- 
you got a stove going, 
and -- 
 <VOX Ah we're in good shape that way (Hx) VOX>. 
ah. 
 Wait a minute. 
 <X Did X> I forget something else, 
too. 
 Ah= yeah. 
We're gonna have to put a register out here. 
 Because y-, 
this  this wall is eventually gonna come out. 
 And so= uh=, 
SETH:  Utility room. 
LARRY:  utility room, 
but it's gonna eventually be part of the kitchen. 
 And we're moving the utility room. 
 So=, 
 and this=. 
@T- -- 
 This is a joke. 
 N_look at this. 
SETH:  (SNIFF) 
LARRY:  (Hx) 
SETH:  [(TSK)_Well] some of these, 
LARRY: [X] 
Maybe maybe this doesn't make any sense, 
[to] -- 
SETH: [well] some of these things you may wanna wait until you do the remodel. 
 [2<X Like X>2] -- 
LARRY: [2I'm th-2] I'm I'm wa- I'm beginning to won[3der if3] -- 
SETH: [3Because what I3] would prob- -- 
 What you can do, 
 [uh=], 
LARRY: [(HICCUP)], 
SETH: is tap right off the plenum. 
Cause the furnace is  somewhere in that general area. 
LARRY:  It's right there, 
yeah. 
SETH:  And you can just tap right off the plenum with a duct, 
 and bring it to this room. 
LARRY: Okay. 
Well that's what we wan[ted to -- 
SETH: [So that can be done], 
LARRY: that's what we wanna kn-  wanna know. 
SETH: that can be done at a later time. 
LARRY:  Alright. 
(H) [But maybe t-] -- 
SETH: [That can be done at]  [2at any time. 
LARRY: [2maybe for the sake of2] your quotation, 
SETH: Really2]. 
LARRY: you should  say, 
this is what it's gonna cost you to put in  a duct here, 
 all these ducts, 
 at [this] time. 
SETH: [Yeah]. 
[2Okay2]. 
LARRY: [2Now I don't2] know if -- 
(H) if we can price em out individually, 
or not. 
SETH:  Sure. 
I call this what, 
utility r-  utility room, 
LARRY: Yeah. 
 Just pu- uh .. call it [a] -- 
SETH: [figure] a duct somewhere on this wall you think? 
LARRY:  Yeah. 
Let's just assume it'd be on this wall. 
SETH:  Okay. 
 Utility room kitchen, 
 that back one we'll call that . pantry, 
LARRY:  Yeah. 
 Pantry, 
 and then you got the dining room glass, 
SETH:  dining room, 
LARRY: glass dining [room], 
SETH: [and then the par]lor. 
LARRY:  and then the  parlor, 
 one [on each] end there. 
SETH: [(SNIFF)] 
 Yeah. 
 Cause we can do em now, 
or we can do em later. 
 But it's not . any more difficult ... to do em .. at a later time. 
 So it's not like you ha=ve to do it now. 
LARRY: Okay. 
SETH:  So the registers that we're connecting to, 
that are existing, 
how many of those we have got. 
We've got the one in the kitchen, 
 and then we've got= uh, 
one in the d-  living room here, 
LARRY:  That guy, 
 then there's one in the bathroom, 
there's one in the s=  study, 
 and there is one in the  library. 
 Or in the parlor. 
 I don't know what we'd do with that. 
 Do we disconnect that, 
if we put two, 
 or do you leave it. 
SETH:  Uh=, 
 yeah I might disconnect that. 
 Well it's not  it's not connected up right now. 
So, 
LARRY:  Oh that's right. 
SETH:  so it'd just be a matter w- -- 
 Actually it sh- -- 
 it should be capped off probably though. 
 And this is the study, 
 one right there, 
 and the bathroom's got one? 
LARRY:  Bathroom's got one, 
over by the shower there. 
 On the floor, 
SETH:  Okay. 
 Okay, 
let me take a look downstairs again, 
LARRY:  okay. 
SETH:  at that furnace. 
DANNY:  (H) 
 This morning we're gonna be looking in the book of Exodus, 
 And we've been talking about uh= (Hx), 
 Vision. 
 And hearing from God. 
 (H) I was trying to come up with a definition, 
in fact I, 
I looked it up in the encyclopedia for vision. 
(H) A=nd (Hx), 
 there is definitely a definition, 
 several, 
 uh=, 
and I didn't really like any of them, 
 (TSK) (H) uh=, 
 (TSK) .. so I th=ought I'd.. try to come up with one of my own. 
 (TSK) . Jim Larson was uh sharing a quote, 
 from Yogi Bara, 
last night, 
and I wanted to @share @that this morning. 
(H) He says you gotta be careful when you don't know where you're going, 
 because you might not get there. 
 <SM Which says so much, 
that we need to know where we're going SM>. 
 And vision, 
really has to do with, 
(H) having an idea of where you're going. 
 Our mission is a goal or task which one is destined to accomplish. 
(H)  Our vision, 
 and here's the -- 
here's the definition I came up with, 
 you can write this down, 
but uh, 
 (H) uh don't use it unless you, 
 uh, 
 agree with it. 
AUD:  [@@@] 
DANNY: [(TSK) (H)] [It's mentally] seeing, 
AUD: [@ @ @] 
DANNY: where one hopes to be, 
 in a specific period of time. 
 (H) It's in your imagination, 
in your  hopes (Hx), 
 that you're looking ahead. 
 And h- . trying to see where you will be, 
 in a specific period- period of time. 
 So our vision for the next few years. 
Our vision for, 
(H) uh, 
 the . (TSK) next ten years. 
Whatever. 
(H) Uh, 
what is our vision. 
 As a church planter, 
Pastor #Queen came, 
 (TSK) (H) . having grown up here, 
and having gone off to-  to school, 
 to seminary, 
 (H) God brought him back, 
to start a church. 
 And he began to seek God's  uh vision, 
 for .. the church. 
(H) And through his own personal experience, 
and through (H)  the Scripture, 
 (TSK) and God gave him a vision, 
 for a church that was committed to being a part of what God was doing, 
(H)  a church that was, 
 invested in building the Kingdom of God. 
 By caring for people where their needs were, 
 and by sharing the truth, 
 of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 
 (TSK)  Our vision is, 
 is a direction of involvement toward a final destination. 
 When I started thinking about missions, 
I  thought immediately of  the Blues Brothers. 
 You know, 
and Dan Ackroyd, 
 comes out, 
I forget what his character was, 
but he says, 
 <Q we're on a mission from God Q>. 
 <SM And that's what the church is about, 
we're on a mission from God SM>. 
 (H) In fact, 
let me clarify it a little more. 
 The church has been given a mission, 
 but our mission is not for us to go and decide what we're gonna do, 
 (H) our mission is to participate in, 
an to carry out  God's mission. 
 Because you see Go=d, 
 is on a mission. 
 God's mission is to build His Kingdom. 
<MRC To build the Kingdom of God MRC>. 
 (H) To bring the world of lost people into a real and personal love (H) relationship, 
 with him. 
 Through faith, 
in His Son, 
Jesus Christ. 
 You know what, 
if our vision, 
 does not include reaching lost people, 
and caring for lost people, 
(H) then it's not God's vision. 
Because the Bible is very clear, 
that Go=d ca=res about lost people. 
AUD: Yes. 
DANNY:  God loves (H)  people who don't have it all together. 
AUD: Yes. 
DANNY:  God loves people who are hurting. 
AUD: Yes. 
DANNY:  God loves people who are suffering. 
Who are seeking. 
 And if our vision, 
as Uptown Baptist Church, 
doesn't include. 
 In fact, 
if our vision as individual  Christians, 
with a relationship with Christ, 
does not include, 
(H)  reaching out, 
and touching, 
 the lives of lost hurting  dying people, 
(H) <MRC it's not a vision from God MRC>. 
 (H) Because God's plan, 
 is, 
 and has always been, 
to use  his people, 
 (H) to carry out His mission. 
 And we're gonna see that, 
as we look at Moses. 
 (TSK) (H) Beginning in the first chapter of Moses. 
I'm not gonna read -- 
 I am gonna read some of it, 
but I'm not gonna read all the way through, 
 because we're gonna try to, 
 breeze through the first four chapters. 
 (H) Let's look how God was involved in Moses. 
 Or how God involved Moses in His mission. 
 #Gary 
one of the things I want us to do, 
 uh, 
on building beautiful day, 
is build a taller  podium. 
MANY:  (LAUGHTER)[=] 
DANNY: [Write that on one of those sheets of paper back there]. 
 We- -- 
we need it about right here. 
MANY:  (LAUGHTER) 
DANNY:  Oops. 
 (H) Okay. 
 (TSK) (H) First thing we're gonna see, 
 is that <MRC God prepares His servants for mission. 
 (H) God  prepares .. his servants .. for mission MRC>. 
 As we read in -- 
 actually as we get to= the second chapter, 
we'll see that, 
 Uh, 
Moses was not only preserved, 
 but he was prepared. 
 Uh for his part in  God's mission. 
 We have to go to chapter one to get a little background. 
 Read with me in verse six of chapter one. 
 (H) <READ Now Joseph and all his brothers, 
 and a=ll that generation died. 
 (H) But the Israelites were fruitful, 
and multiplied greatly, 
and became exceedingly numerous. 
(H) so that the land was filled with them. 
 (H) Then a new king, 
 who did not know about Joseph, 
came to power in Egypt. 
 Look, 
 he said to his people. 
 the Israelites have become .. much too numerous .. for us. 
 Come, 
we must deal shrewdly with them, 
for- -- 
 or they will become even more numerous, 
(H) and if war breaks out, 
 will join our enemies. 
 fight against us, 
and leave the country. 
 (H) So they put the slave masters over them. 
to oppress them and f- -- 
 with forced .. labor. 
(H) And they built  Python, 
 and Ramses. 
 As store cities. 
 For Pharaoh. 
 But the more they were oppressed, 
the more they multiplied and spread. 
 So the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites. 
And worked them ruthlessly. 
 (H) They made their lives bitter, 
with hard labor in brick and mortar. 
(H) And with a=ll kinds of work in the fields. 
(H)  In all their hard labor, 
the Egyptians used them, 
 ruthlessly READ>. 
 The king, 
or the Pharaoh, 
 was a little upset. 
Because, 
 the Israelites, 
who were their slaves. 
 who were their servants. 
 As they took a census, 
 they realized, 
that the Israelites'  n=umbers, 
 were= catching up. 
 With their own. 
 Of the Egyptians. 
 And this was upsetting, 
because he saw this as a  national threat. 
 (H) . From his perspective, 
they w- -- 
 they r- -- 
 you know, 
he just (H) knew that they were gonna grow to a number, 
and they were gonna outnumber the Egyptians, 
and then they were just gonna take over. 
 You know, 
if any (H) other countries decided to attack, 
(H) Uh, 
and, 
 to=  to battle, 
 uh, 
 the Egyptians, 
that he just knew that the Israelites were gonna join them, 
and were gonna  overthrow from the inside. 
(H)  So the next part of the chapter, 
he begins to= (Hx), 
you know, 
first of all he b- -- 
he  works the men very hard. 
He said man if I work these guys ha=rd, 
there not gonna be going home to their wives, 
and there not gonna be, 
(H) uh=, 
(H)  having babies. 
AUD:  [@@] 
DANNY: [You know, 
I] guess that was part of his plan. 
That's his first [strategy. 
AUD: [@@] 
DANNY: so] let's make it hard for them. 
Let's @really @work, 
(H) work em,

 have babies. 
And they [continued to] multiply. 
AUD: [@@] 
DANNY:  So he g- devises another plan. 
 He goes to the midwives. 
 You know the Israelites had midwives. 
They didn't have doctors, 
but they had, 
(H) uh, 
women, 
 who when a, 
when  one of the Israelite women were gonna have a baby, 
then these midwives just come in, 
and help  in the labor process. 
 (H) . Or in the birthing process. 
 And so he goes to the midwives and says, 
 listen. 
Here's what I want you to do. 
 you go, 
and you go ahead, 
and you do your part, 
 and you help these .. these mothers, 
(H) but if they have a boy, 
 I want you to make sure that, 
 that boy dies. 
 If it's a girl, 
you go ahead and let it live. 
 And that was his plan. 
 Well the midwives, 
 you know, 
what could they say, 
this is the  the Pharaoh, 
 (H) so they agreed to it, 
but then they didn't do it. 
 Because they feared God, 
more than they did Pharaoh. 
(H) And when uh he calls em, 
he says what's going on. 
They're still multiplying. 
@@ [There's still boys being born here]. 
AUD: [@@@@ @@@@] 
DANNY: (H)  what is going on. 
 The midwives said, 
 well these, 
 these mothers, 
 they're having the babies without us.

they're not telling us.

They're s- --

 they don't need us]. 
 And so Pharaoh comes up with another plan. 
It ends up in the  final verse of this chapter. 
 (H)  Verse twenty-two. 
<READ Then Pharaoh gave this order, 
to all his people. 
Every boy that is born, 
must be -- 
 you must throw into the Nile. 
 (H) But let every girl live READ>. 
 So he's ordering his people to go. 
 And every boy that is born to the Israelites, 
 to  to kill em. 
Throw em in the river. 
 Well Moses was born about this time. 
 And this is how God preserved . Moses. 
 Now Moses's mother . loved her child. 
 And she didn't want to throw him in. 
I don't think any of the mothers did. 
 And she wasn't gonna do it herself, 
 (H) and she was one of these that had the baby, 
without telling anybody, 
except her immediate family. 
(H)  And Moses already, 
 when he was born, 
 had an older sister and an older brother. 
 And the mother, 
 now when I was growing up, 
and I heard this story, 
I just assumed that the mother, 
(H) was hiding the baby in the reeds. 
And that's where she was hiding him. 
But it says for three months, 
she hid the baby, 
(H) didn't say anything about the %=  the -- 
in the river, 
or in the, 
in the uh  basket. 
(H) Uh, 
but then when he was three months old, 
 she j- -- 
she  was assuming that she was gonna get caught pretty soon, 
(H)  and so she devised a plan. 
 And it doesn't say here that she devised a plan, 
(H)  but, 
believe me, 
 This mother knew what she was doing. 
 She b-  she m- .. got a basket. 
 She  perhaps made the basket. 
 Probably did. 
(H) and then she put, 
 what they call pitch, 
or tar, 
 (H) uh, 
on it, 
so that it  would float. 
 So that water wouldn't come up through it. 
(H) And she put  a blanket, 
 put the baby in it, 
 wrapped the baby in it-, 
(H) and she told -- 
 she brought it down to the river. 
 Now she didn't just go anywhere in the river, 
 (H) She brought it to a specific place. 
 Not just because there were reeds there, 
(H) but because, 
 the Pharaoh's daughter ba=thed .. there. 
 And this was a selected place. 
(H) The mother took the baby, 
(H) put the baby, 
put Moses  (H) in the water. 
 And told her sister to keep an eye on it. 
 To keep an eye on him so that, 
(H) nothing bad happened, 
(H) but also, 
there was an- another motive, 
that we'll get to in just a second. 
 (H) So the w- -- 
so Moses was floating along in the water. 
 The Pharaoh's daughter came down to -- 
to take her bath (Hx)? 
 And she sees the basket. 
 And she sends her servant out to get the basket and bring it to her. 
(H) And she opens it up, 
there's Moses, 
and he begins to cry, 
(H) and  Pharaoh's daughter felt sorry for Moses. 
 And she just decided to keep him. 
 It said, 
she realized said this is an Israelite baby. 
 (H) <VOX Aw- aw, 
poor thi=ng VOX>. 
AUD: @@@@ 
DANNY: (H)  And so she, 
 she decides to keep him. 
 We=ll. 
 Here's what  pha- -- 
uh, 
Moses's sister did. 
 That was her cue. 
 (H) She comes out from hiding, 
and says, 
(H)  Oh, 
 whatever your name is, 
@@@ [(H) @@@ (H) 
MANY: [(LAUGHTER)] 
DANNY: says], 
 oh, 
mighty princess. 
 Allow me=, 
 to get a nurse for .. the baby. 
 I know of an Israelite nurse, 
that can take care  of this baby. 
 Guess who. 
 (H) <SM Her mother SM>. 
 So she goes and gets=  the mother. 
(H) Now. 
 Why do I think this is something that . the mother knew about. 
 Cause it ends up that, 
 . the mother, 
 not only, 
 had her child, 
 to stay alive. 
(H)  But she also, 
 got to take care of him, 
 and got paid for it. 
MANY:  (LAUGHTER) 
DANNY:  So God not only spared his life, 
but He provided, 
 uh, 
for -- 
 for that whole family. 
 (TSK) (H) But especially for Moses. 
 (H) So we see how, 
 God preserved, 
 Moses. 
 We also see how God  prepared Moses, 
 (H) because in the % -- 
 Moses's life is kinda divided into three (H)  stages. 
Each being forty years. 
The first forty years he was in Egypt. 
 (H) The second forty years he was  a shepherd. 
 (H)  And the third forty years he was l=eading the people out of Israel. 
 And in this first forty years. 
 Moses  got the best training, 
 in the world at that time. 
 (H)  His foundational training came from his mother. 
 Cause as the nanny, 
 and that's what she was at that point, 
even though she was his mother, 
she was his nanny, 
 (H)  She .. trained him ... in the foundations, 
 uh, 
trained him, 
taught him who he was, 
 (H) taught him about his Hebrew origin, 
 and the customs of the Israel- . Israelites. 
 Taught him the foundational belief . in .. the true God, 
 (H) taught him of God's promise to Abraham, 
(H) to multiply  his descendants, 
 and make a .. mighty nation, 
 of them. 
 (H) Probably the first four or five years, 
 the bulk of his time was spent with his mother. 
 And he, 
 I'm sure she told him that, 
 that uh, 
she was his mother, 
his real mother, 
 and and about what had happened, 
cause we wouldn't know about it, 
 (H) uh, 
 if .. she didn't. 
 But not only did he get this religious training, 
 (TSK) and this foundational  belief .. (H) in a r- in a real God, 
 but he also, 
was exposed to the best education that Egypt had to offer. 
 Exposed to the wisest teachers, 
and the best culture offered in the world at that time, 
(H) he learned about the politics and customs  of the courts, 
 of course this would help him later on, 
 when he had to come back and, 
 and uh, 
 and deal with the courts from .. a different perspective, 
 but that first forty years was spent  in being trained. 
 And he was trained well. 
 And he had great knowledge. 
 A lot of knowledge. 
 That he was uh, 
 that  God provided for him, 
through these  means. 
 And then for the next forty years. 
he was exiled. 
 From Egypt. 
 Because, 
in order to -- 
 thinking, 
 that because he was an Israelite, 
 by birth, 
 uh, 
and seeing  an Israeli being  abused, 
 uh, 
he stepped in, 
and he killed the Egyptian that was abusing him, 
(H)  thinking that no one else knew except this person that he had saved, 
 (H) he buried him, 
 and then a few days later, 
you know, 
thinking well it's  it's all cool, 
 nobody knows, 
I'll just  go on. 
(H) He tries to help, 
 or tries to intervene between two other, 
 uh, 
 Hebrew, 
 that were arguing amongst themself and, 
 and, 
 he tries to be a peacemaker, 
and they say, 
(H) you know, 
who made you judge, 
 w- what about this, 
you just killed the guy the other day, 
(H) Uh=, 
and he realized that people knew. 
 And he realized if these- -- 
 if these men knew, 
(H) then probably Pharaoh was gonna hear pretty soon, 
and so he left. 
He fled. 
 (H) He ran. 
 He went out into the wilderness. 
 After a few days of  uh walking, 
he  comes upon a a scene, 
where these two young ladies are herding  their father's sheep, 
(H) and uh, 
some, 
 uh, 
 mean guys, 
(H) who knows, 
I don't  remember who it was, 
but anyway, 
they came up and tried to, 
 to= uh, 
 take advantage of the  two ladies, 
trying to take care of the sheep, 
(H) and uh, 
%  and I I assume they were trying to steal the sheep, 
or trying to steal the women, 
 either way, 
 uh, 
but, 
 Moses intervened, 
and he ran them off. 
 And saved their lives. 
and saved  their .. livestock. 
(H) And so they invited him to come with them, 
to  to their home, 
and they told their father what had happened, 
and he invited Moses to stay with them, 
(H) Moses ends up marrying. 
 uh, 
 one of the young ladies. 
 As #Ken  shared with us the other day, 
it was a  a mixed marriage, 
because these, 
 uh, 
 this family was Black. 
 (H)  So for the next .. forty years. 
 he becomes a sheep herder, 
for his father-in-law. 
 Who was a  a Midian priest. 
 And during that forty years, 
he he g- gained some other training. 
 First of all he became an outdoorsman. 
He became used to being out  in the wilderness. 
 And that's gonna be important for him, 
for his  final forty years. 
(H)  Another thing he's, 
is, 
 the area where he herded the sheep, 
was a  a huge  area. 
 And uh he got to know the terrain, 
He got to know his way around. 
 And that was important because he was gonna spend his final forty years, 
(H) in that same area. 
and it was important that he knew where there-, 
(H) the w-  waterholes were and, 
and where the dangerous  areas were. 
 (H)  Uh, 
 and so God  prepared him. 
 (H) God also= has  prepared us, 
and is preparing us, 
 for h- -- 
for our part, 
 in God's mission. 
 God is continually  building character. 
And I think, 
 this  middle forty years for Moses, 
was a=, 
was a time where God really built character. 
Cause he no longer had everything he wanted, 
 uh, 
at his fingertips, 
(H) uh, 
he had to learn some things. 
He had to learn. 
 He had to (H) learn how to depend on God. 
 ON this God that he had learned about. 
 From his mother. 
 And God is interested in building character in us. 
 as individuals. 
 In fact, 
God is more concerned about  our character, 
than what we do. 
 And how we do it. 
 And so a lot of what we experience, 
we get frustrated with, 
 but God's  purpose .. is to build character within us. 
 And so when we're trying to decide w- which we should do or not do, 
 something that we're tempted to do, 
(H) we need to remember that, 
God's more concerned about our character, 
(H) and we should  be obedient to Him, 
because that's how He builds  our character. 
 I believe that God has created, 
 and preserved, 
 and prepared Uptown Baptist Church. 
 To be involved in His mission. 
 To be involved in reaching out to the unloved and the hurting. 
 To be an influence. 
 to the community of Uptown, 
 for the Kingdom of God. 
 To be a beacon of light, 
 for those who are lost, 
 and as our sign says on top, 
 to proclaim that  Christ died for our sins. 
 God has also created and prepared Uptown Baptist Church, 
 to be a model for urban  church .. missions to the world. 
 And that wasn't  our reasoning, 
we didn't set out to do the things we do, 
so that we could be a model, 
(H)  or so that we could  get ... publicity, 
(H)  But God has saw- seen fit to use us in that way. 
(H) And this is not for our pride, 
 this is just . a reality. 
 I'm amazed at how . people from all over the world, 
have have come, 
(H) to the city, 
and they've come to Uptown Baptist Church, 
because they heard about us somewhere else, 
in another country. 
 or they read a book, 
 uh that talked about Uptown Baptist Church. 
 God has crea- -- 
also=  created an prepared you and me, 
 to be involved in His plan. 
 First of all He's called us each to a love relationship with Him. 
 Some of us have accepted that call, 
 and some  are still struggling with it. 
 But still, 
 He wants to have a love  relationship, 
 with each person that is in this room. 
 He's brought us together from many backgrounds, 
 many very different backgrounds. 
 to be a family. 
 (H) A family of followers  of Christ. 
 A family to be involved  in God's mission. 
 Building the Kingdom of God. 
 I was talking to #Greg on Friday. 
#Greg #Gey, 
 and he was sharing wi- -- 
somehow we got in a conversation, 
and he was saying something about, 
he  he really needed (Hx)  intellectual stimulation, 
because he tended to be more intellectual, 
(H)  and we were talking about why, 
some people were intellectual and some weren't. 
 And God just . flashed in my mind. 
And I said #Greg. 
 You know God, 
 created you to be intellectual, 
so that you could relate to others who are intellectuals. 
So that you could share %with them on their level. 
(H) Because Go=d didn't create us for our purpose, 
 God created .. us for His purpose. 
(H) And that's something we have to keep, 
(H)  in -- 
 before us. 
 God has created us, 
m=ade us like we are. 
Allowed us to experience the things that we have experienced. 
(H)  For his purpose. 
 And it's for us to= seek Him, 
and to know what His purpose is. 
 #Papa #Joe has been a, 
 a very strong influence in this community. 
 (H) Not because of his education, 
 his educations came from the streets. 
 And as he came to . a relationship with Jesus Christ, 
he came from a background, 
 that w- had survi=ved, 
from the streets. 
 (TSK) (H) . He was an alcoholic. 
 Now w- how- -- 
why= has God use him. 
 He wasn't educated, 
 he didn't go through special training, 
 it's because, 
 God prepared him, 
 with the experience of his life, 
(H) so that he could reach out to other people who are  going through the same experience. 
 So you can't say well I don't have an education. 
Or I don't -- 
I can't speak. 
or I can't do this. 
(H) You have to know that whatever  God has given you, 
Whatever (H) experience that God has brought you through. 
 That He wants to use it. 
 To reach people, 
 for His Kingdom. 
 The second thing I want us to know, 
 (H) . from this st- .. story of Moses, 
is that God reveals His mission  to His servants. 
>ENV: ((SIREN_BEGINS)) 
DANNY:  The first that God prepares His servants for His mission, 
 the second is that God reveals His mission . to His servants. 
 We have to go to= Exodus three, 
 and see how God gets Moses's attention.

how come this is happening,

happens to five guys like you.
